Another rational endorsement for Stock footage as an alternative, not necessarily because of quality, but because the TIME involved isn't much different, and in many cases, the generative side  is significantly longer because prompting to get what you want can be...a process to say the least.

> AI video is best treated like any other plugin: a timesaver, not the final storyteller. For client reels I drop a low-res copy into Runway to strip boom poles, export the clean plate, then pass only that slice through Topaz Video AI to recover detail before comping it back in Premiere. Shot tracking stays solid because I keep the metadata from the original clip. Workflows move faster if every AI layer gets its own track and a \_GEN suffix so the team can swap it out when standards change. I’ve tested Topaz Video AI and Runway, but AdComposer AI mostly rides shotgun when I need tight social copy that lines up with the finished cuts. Used right, it’s just another power tool, not a shortcut.

> 
> Yeah.  I recently played with, despite being one of the grumpy old farts who automatically defaults to avoiding most of the AI stuff.  I wanted to see if the actor had said a line a certain way in any of the takes.  Premiere had transcribed the files, so theoretically easy.  But I had to click on each file, one by one, to search the transcripts separately.
> 
> If I was using a computer from the 1980's and I had a directory full of text files that I wanted to search for a phrase, I could do that in two seconds even if there were a zillion files.  The UX for the AI stuff seems to be rushed out and clunky, and they skip over kind of basic already-solved stuff that I would expect to be easy on a 40 year old computer, to implement the really fancy stuff.  The AI model doing the speech recognition was generally pretty good.  The transcript itself on any given file was fine to good.  (It would be better if I could easily point it at the text of the screenplay as a word source for the recognition dictionary!  Narrowed model speech recognition worked perfectly fine in the 1990's, even with unique sci fi jargon.)  But the focus 100% on the "sexy" AI guts part, and the UX for stuff like "search and filter text" gets a back seat because that doesn't generate hype.  It just gets bolted on from an implementation-first orientation, and not thought about from use-case-first orientation.

> I think the best use of AI would be to help cover for mistakes or enhance what was already shot. I’m thinking of how I really like the Enhance Speech AI tool for audio. Things like that I think I would find most helpful. I don’t think I have much of a need for being able to just generate whatever I want, but I do think there’s potential use in extending clips, removing logos, sharpening an out of focus shot, or helping with resolution changes off the top of my head. The company I work for is trying to integrate our print writers into doing more video work and sometimes their shots need some love

> Say I shot something and it lost focus for a split second, or even was purely defocused, it would be incredible to have AI reproduce the image to save the shot.

> Yes. So much of the conversation around AI has been around Generative AI (image / video). I think it has its place, but where the real value is, i.e. where it really help scale up the creator, is if you start thinking about AI / agents as a team that can help you with all of the stuff around creating (i.e. planning, brainstorming, scripting tools, etc....).

> The only real thing I've seen AI be genuinely useful for is transcripting, and is probably the one thing I'd like out of premiere the most. Premiere's current automatic transcript generation is seriously lacking. It capitalizes random words and doesn't understand when people are actually done talking. I've seen other programs use some form of AI to enhance transcription and it saves me a massive headache, I'd love to see it be implemented in some way.
> 
> However, when it comes to AI-video generation, I can't say I see any use case for it, in really any way. I had a shot that unfortunately cut a little before we wanted, so we tried using the generative extend tool to get a few more seconds out of it, and it was absolutely unusable. It muddied the footage and was immediately noticable as AI generated. I haven't touched the feature since.
> 
> My issue with AI (beyond it's environmental and ethical/moral implications) is mainly on it being shoved into programs with little real use case that isn't either far too expensive and just as time consuming as doing it yourself, or immediately instills a new form of uncanny valley within me and everyone who sees it. It can be wildly useful and I'll admit I actually think it's kind of cool, but until we can find a way to implement it as a tool without using a massive amount of energy, as well as find more use cases beyond "I made a video of Barrack Obama getting arrested isn't that funny," I don't really see any reason to go near AI-video generation.

> Since most models were unethically trained, I try to avoid them like the plague. I did try some just for fun but never on actual projects. It's very tempting to use them for specific things (style transfers, assets generation, etc ) but most of the time I have a very specific mental image of what I want that no matter how much I try different prompts, I feel that I am wasting my time, like, in the time it takes the AI to generate things I could have just created the assets I need from scratch. 
> 
> Since Adobe's approach for the training was one of the most ethical ones (I recently learned about Moonvalley's Marey) and it comes with my subscription, I started to explore it more.
> 
> I tried it on simple motion graphics project. Very soon I realized that I was not going to be able to just use the generated videos as they were (no much control over camera movement, composition, etc) so I decided to just use Photoshop to create the frame references with a green background for keying and composite the elements in After Effects later. It basically became a game of creating references and trying prompts until I had an asset that I could use, and I still had to mask, freeze frames or tweak a lot of things in After Effects.
> 
> I like to have control over every element on a project (as most directors or art directors would) so using AI generated videos for individual assets instead of trying to make it generate the whole thing was a better approach for the kind of projects I work on. I still couldn't generate everything I needed so I had to combine generated videos with traditional layers …

> Mostly useless for now. The quality just isn’t there. There are two many obvious signs it’s AI generated, and I’m not talking extra fingers. The texture and lighting is always just… off, even on the latest and best models. If it gets better the utility could go up. 
> 
> Where I see AI being incredibly valuable as an edit is actually more around transcripts and search. Being able to quickly search large interview, for example. I really hope there features grow, and maybe even get editing action based on it. “Create a sting out of every clip where they talk about [insert topic]” for example. A prompt based assistant editor.

> I think AI-generated everything is pretty much trash. To use a phrase my sister came up with, "I'm an A+ student and this thing can only give me C- work." Its uses are completely unknown to me, since anything I can ask it to do I can do better, and I'm an absolute amateur. It might take me more time, sure, but I'll not only have a better picture/cut/transition, but I'll have learned how to do it too. As it turns out, this is fun for me, and I don't like the idea of the machine not only having my fun, but turning in worse work. 
> 
> Straight up, I think if you use AI-generation, you're just cheap and lazy. That's all it says to me. And this is a very expensive program, so why the hell would I pay all this money every month just for people to look at my work and say "this looks cheap and lazy?"

The digs at Adobe aside (I am an employee after all), I sincerely appreciate that you took the time and shared these thoughts in great detail; it's clearly very genuine. While I don't agree with it all, there are some undeniable realities you mention above that come along w/the territory in this new landscape, and they're not all great.

> I use it daily to expand backgrounds and foregrounds for social media content. Also adding stuff in the frame, then rotoscoping the foreground. Full generative stuff is currently not valid for publication (mostly) but not using the best tools for the job just because its AI doesnt make any sense. I think a lot of people are against AI, but there's a difference between being against AI and adamantly not using it because you dont believe in it.

> What are you making 8K imax films for aliens with eyes that have 16k resolution? 
> 
> I’ve already put AI video in nationwide commercials. No one has a clue but those creatives will call me back because I made magic. But you won’t even investigate. Have you seen what Astra can do? And that’s freaking gen 1! Starlight takes old footage and makes it look amazing. I don’t mean like that weird Beatles film, I mean like straight up fresh. I’ve spent years in film color correction sessions, I have some semblance of knowledge. You definitely should at least keep your ear to the ground a bit.
