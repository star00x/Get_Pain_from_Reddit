> I pay for Gemini for coding and business analysis purposes. i find that its the best at Coding and Research related tasks. Translating Natural Language prompts to a well structured JSON, parsing the nuance of my intent, the complex look/color grade/ camera and lens... etc, was a very complicated task that Gemini's big context window and logic was best at. I hit a wall using Chatgpt in this specific case (generating JSON prompts), because i used up all the memory, and it started forgetting. Chatgpt is wonderful though at generating amazingly detailed Natural Language prompts. and it will give you great strategies to barely pass the decency filter if you are getting stopped by it. Gemini tends to be a square, it's decency filter is way too conservative, it will change interactions and attire to be more rigid, plain and dull. so when you want Natural Language prompts use Chatgpt, When you want Code or to reverse engineer a particular visual style, you have to use JSON and Gemini.

> The issue i was trying to solve is that my comprehensive detailed prompts generated by Chatgpt were still outputting inconsistent "look and feel", Sora was creating 4 outputs with non-matching white balance, some where painterly, etc. I wanted a method to SET IN STONE the visual look and style across a series of images. the preset didn't work, so i took the time to iterate with Gemini until it created a solid well structured JSON which i paste directly in the image prompt window as is in sora. This almost guarantees the look I'm going for.

> You're running into one of the most persistent and frustrating limitations of current generative video models like Sora: prompt adherence and character consistency, especially in highly specific visual constraints like facial features, attire, and historical accuracy, is still far from reliable — no matter how precisely you word your prompts.

> Sora is trained on a massive dataset with latent biases about “medieval” characters. If you mention anything resembling “Dante” or a “poet from 1300s Florence,” it will likely default to a stereotyped, often generic, medieval man — usually bearded, sometimes bald, and wearing vague robes. This is because the visual associations encoded during training are stronger than your negative prompts.

> Even removing “Dante” from the prompt doesn’t always help, because the visual tropes are tied to the era and occupation you’re describing (e.g., “Italian medieval poet”).

> Telling Sora to “not do” something (e.g., “no beard,” “not bald,” “forbidden”) often fails, especially in visuals. Unlike text models, visual generation models are not good at understanding negation. They can interpret positive attributes better than prohibitions.

> I was running into this in my art project, the most solid way I found was to prompt using JSON, I iterated with Gemini for like two hours, showing him my natural language prompts and the outputs and what I need changing and specified the prompts need to be in JSON. That gave me the best consistency in visual style, and character look across a group of images. I now have a structured JSON template for my specific project. Which I also attached to on other gem. I describe what I need and it creates the JSON prompt needed for my desired output.

> About historical figure likeness. My best advice is to never use their names directly. Ask chatgpt in text to give you a comprehensive visual discription of your target character according to historical sources. Then ask them to: write visual discription of "new name" who exactly matches the likeness of "historic figure" in all aspects, optimize the language for Sora prompt.
> 
> From then on, use this new discription for your character in scene prompt.
