> I’m disappointed with Gen 4. First, the queue lines are over ten minutes. If I’m paying $100 a month, I shouldn’t have to wait in a queue that long.
> 
> I’ve read all the documentation to adjust my prompting, but Gen 3 Alpha Turbo still produces better results with illustrated characters. Gen 4 morphs them into a cartoonish mess and creates motion and gestures that are WAY too fast and chaotic.
> 
> It seems like Runway got a lot of feedback from people complaining about slow-motion results with Gen 3, so for Gen 4 they over corrected and subject’s movements are often too fast and chaotic. That is, once they get going. For some reason with Gen 4 the first three or four seconds of a ten second video the character will often remain motionless, then the prompt will kick in and they go nuts. 
> 
> However, there are a lot of features yet to be released for Gen 4 such as last frame and camera controls, so we’ll see. I just hope they solved the “Static camera” also forces the subject to be static problem.

> Do you have any tips on how to prompt better on Sora? Im new to AI gen and am struggling a bit. The content restrictions are a pain, but I can't seem to get anything animated correctly. Even if it's a reddit post or YT video that you got good info from, I'd love any pointer in the right direction

> Nah. They peaked. There are smaller companies doing way better. I think they hit a talent / budget wall.

> Kling is stunning. You should also try Hailuo. And PixVerse for animation. Or Pika for live action edits.

> If you've got a thing for ComfyUI, WanVideo is good too, though a little frustrating. But you can do a lot of neat stuff with it like controlnets and custom LoRAs for your own styles.

> I haven't tried Gen4 yet, but Gen3's speed has always been its most impressive quality to me.  Yes Kling is slower, but it's generations have sped up quite a bit just in the last couple weeks - 5 seconds of i2v in Professional mode on version 1.6 generates in less than a minute consistently, 10 seconds closer to 2 minutes. What takes the most time is using their Elements feature or doing extensions - can be 7-8 minutes.

> I also got an impression (from the clips I've seen) that Gen-4 doesn't really feel like a whole generation above Gen-3, it feels more like they are trying to catch up with Kling and Luma and an honest thing would be to call it Gen-3.5. Sora on the one hand has amazing capabilities but is a) overpriced (for a 1080p version without a watermark) and b) is terrible at img2vid. I would say Luma Ray2 and Kling 1.6 have the best visual quality rn and Veo2 probably has the best prompt adherence. Don't know where exactly Gen-4 lands between those 3.

> I strongly disagree; I played a bit with Gen-4 today and it's very much in my books.  
> Here's a demo reel: two stitched 10-sec clips, 50% slowmo - 100% Gen-4 [https://useapi.net/blog/250402](https://useapi.net/blog/250402)  
> The whole thing took 5 shots total (had to throw away only 3 clips which is quite good imho)  
> Music is by Mureka AI.
