> Super impressive workflow — love how structured your weekly system is. I’ve been testing Vizard alongside my generation stack, mainly for the repurposing side. It auto-pulls multiple strong clips from long videos, gives them viral scoring, and the editor lets me tweak subtitles like editing text. The scheduling + calendar also makes the Friday batch-finalization step smoother. Might be worth trying as an add-on layer if you ever want to streamline the post-gen pipeline.

> Side question: are people still earning from AI videos? I was under the impression that platforms stopped paying for AI generated content. Or was it just youtube?
