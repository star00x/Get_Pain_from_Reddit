> Excellent breakdown! As someone working with batch video processing via APIs, I'd add:

> \*\*For automation workflows:\*\*
> 
> \- Combine multiple tools: Use Runway Gen-4 for variety, Agent Opus for consistency
> 
> \- API integration is key: Most have REST APIs for programmatic batch processing
> 
> \- Consider cost per asset: Track actual $/video instead of monthly subscriptions
> 
> \- Implement quality gates: Automated review before final output saves hours
> 
> 
> 
> \*\*Hidden costs:\*\*
> 
> \- Version control for prompts (what generation that worked well?)
> 
> \- Cleanup workflow: Scripts to re-encode, match aspect ratios
> 
> \- Iteration cycles: Plan for 2-3 generations per final asset

> \*\*For production use:\*\*

> \- Combine with orchestration (Zapier/n8n) to trigger generation on schedule

> The $500 is valuable learning data. The real cost is operational efficiency once you automate the selection + iteration process.

> This is a solid breakdown, appreciate you actually testing these and sharing what worked versus what burned budget. The pattern you're hitting is something we see constantly: tools are impressive in demos but fall apart in production workflows. The real cost isn't the $500 on generators, it's the hours spent stitching outputs together, fixing inconsistencies, and babysitting each generation until it's usable.
> 
> We've been building automation workflows that treat these AI video tools as components in a larger system rather than standalone solutions. The orchestration layer handles the repetitive parts like feed in assets, generate variations, route based on quality checks, archive what works, retry what doesn't. Turns out the boring workflow automation around the flashy AI tools is what actually saves time and money.
> 
> For agency work especially, the bottleneck isn't generation speed, it's the manual review and iteration cycles. Automating those handoffs between tools, client feedback loops, and asset management tends to have bigger ROI than finding the perfect generator.
