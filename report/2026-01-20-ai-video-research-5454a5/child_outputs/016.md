| "I love that Premiere does transcript generation for free, but the editing process is clunky. For many of my videos I'm paying 50 cents/minute to transcribe them simply because of how easy to use the software is." | 8 | 成本负担/为易用性付费 | https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/1m7etdp/whats_your_take_on_aigenerated_video_useful/n4rjgs8/ |
| "The only real thing I've seen AI be genuinely useful for is transcripting, and is probably the one thing I'd like out of premiere the most. Premiere's current automatic transcript generation is seriously lacking." | 42 | 现有功能不足 | https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/1m7etdp/whats_your_take_on_aigenerated_video_useful/n4qy7e4/ |

| "the generative side is significantly longer because prompting to get what you want can be...a process to say the least." | 3 | 生成流程耗时 | https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/1m7etdp/whats_your_take_on_aigenerated_video_useful/n4sqefc/ |
| "the misconception that it's somehow 'immediate' (and doesn't require subsequent generations and re-prompting and editing prompts over and over) is really a huge miscalculation." | 4 | 反复提示/时间成本 | https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/1m7etdp/whats_your_take_on_aigenerated_video_useful/n4qzcm9/ |
| "the 1080p limitation currently imposed means I can't ever use any current AI models (I need 4k in my workflow to provide wide and vertical crops without any loss" | 6 | 分辨率限制 | https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/1m7etdp/whats_your_take_on_aigenerated_video_useful/n4r67pf/ |
| "Premiere had transcribed the files, so theoretically easy. But I had to click on each file, one by one, to search the transcripts separately." | 3 | 多文件检索缺失 | https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/1m7etdp/whats_your_take_on_aigenerated_video_useful/n50jy5q/ |
| "Being able to quickly search large interview, for example...“Create a sting out of every clip where they talk about [insert topic]” | 4 | 语义检索/智能剪辑需求 | https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/1m7etdp/whats_your_take_on_aigenerated_video_useful/n4skbmp/ |

| "I really hope there features grow, and maybe even get editing action based on it." | 4 | 自动化编辑期待 | https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/1m7etdp/whats_your_take_on_aigenerated_video_useful/n4skbmp/ |
| "As a video editor the most useful thing I would want is the ability to stabilize a shaky clip" | 5 | 画面稳定需求 | https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/1m7etdp/whats_your_take_on_aigenerated_video_useful/n4ricro/ |
| "Warp Stabilizer would require the clip to be zoomed in to fix this, maybe image generation wouldn't?" | 5 | 稳定器限制 | https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/1m7etdp/whats_your_take_on_aigenerated_video_useful/n4rkapl/ |

#### Workflow descriptions
