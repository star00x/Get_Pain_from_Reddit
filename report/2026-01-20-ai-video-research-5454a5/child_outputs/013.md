#### Key pain signals
| Comment | Score | Signal | Link |
|---------|-------|--------|------|

| "Each video we produce in this pipeline takes anywhere from 2 to 6 hours to render (shorter if there's little movement or no need to upscale beyond 2k)." | 1 | 渲染耗时高、吞吐受限 | https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1q9xvhw/how_are_you_automating_1000_product_showcase/nz2ub7t/ |

#### Workflow descriptions
> "Task scheduler running API's to various video generators that have API's (eg. Runway) then stitch sound, text and voice using ffmpeg based automators and finally using another api to upscale to 2k and 4k."
