| "I’m an AI Architect and my team has been testing looking to create life-like models for our products.  I have to say that none of them are ready for primetime…yet. You prompt “walking toward you” and they walk directly away. “Arm up” will result in arms down. Frustrating." | 7 | 工具不可靠/可控性差 | https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1mi9y9m/whats_the_current_frontier_in_aigenerated/n720iwd/ |
| "Former animator here. I feel trying to control the overall direction via text rather than via bones with the occasional keyframe would be extremely slow and unintuitive, even if it did interpret intent more accurately." | 4 | 工作流不合直觉/效率低 | https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1mi9y9m/whats_the_current_frontier_in_aigenerated/n73z2fl/ |
| "A rigged character that the "AI" then renders over top of would be the ideal control mechanism." | 4 | 需要更可控的混合工作流 | https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1mi9y9m/whats_the_current_frontier_in_aigenerated/n73z2fl/ |
| "What I’m curious about is the ethical + legal front. Some of these avatars are getting so good, it's hard to tell if you're watching a real actor. We need better frameworks before this becomes mainstream in media." | 4 | 合规/伦理风险不清 | https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1mi9y9m/whats_the_current_frontier_in_aigenerated/n72a2cn/ |
| "The lack of technical discussion around these tools is probably because they're still pretty new. I'm curious to see how they evolve in terms of ethics and usage guidelines" | 7 | 标准/规范缺失 | https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1mi9y9m/whats_the_current_frontier_in_aigenerated/n724gub/ |
