| "This dogshit is not worth $200 per month when Huyuan is open source and Kling, Minimax & Pika are free. The OG Model ? Debatable, since we never even got to test its output quality ourselves, for all we know what we saw were most likely cherrypicked for marketing purposes." | 25 | 价格敏感 + 免费替代 | https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1hqvg5h/why_is_sora_so_bad_despite_all_the_hype_it_had/m4t81ea/ |

| "Their UI is great, the features are brilliant if the model was actually good. My experience with Sora img2vid was my image just being visible for one frame and the scene changing into something else entirely from the second frame onward. Same prompt, same image on Pika 2.0 gave me a much better result, satisfactory. Kling 1.6 was a near perfect result." | 25 | 质量对比失败/工作流受阻 | https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1hqvg5h/why_is_sora_so_bad_despite_all_the_hype_it_had/m4szuw0/ |

> "I have hundreds of Sora generations at this point which I could show to people and for your average everyday human - 8/10 would not be able to tell it's AI. For consistent 20-second generations, the amount of sheer dynamism that every generation manages to pump out is unparalled. High end fashion videos? Professional marketing videos? Vintage period era clips? Landscape shots? It literally makes me anything I ask of it - 2x720p 20 second variations - 5 of these at once so 10 20 second generations - and I can literally take between 10-15 seconds out of each of those gens and use them for content that looks professional, real, and convincing."
