#### Key pain signals
| Comment | Score | Signal | Link |
|---------|-------|--------|------|
| "The real cost isn't the $500 on generators, it's the hours spent stitching outputs together, fixing inconsistencies, and babysitting each generation until it's usable." | 6 | Manual iteration cost / production workflow friction | https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1pdkrwj/what_i_learned_from_burning_500_on_ai_video/ns79j06/ |

#### Workflow descriptions
> "We've been building automation workflows that treat these AI video tools as components in a larger system rather than standalone solutions. The orchestration layer handles the repetitive parts like feed in assets, generate variations, route based on quality checks, archive what works, retry what doesn't."
