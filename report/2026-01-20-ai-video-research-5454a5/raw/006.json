    "selftext": "Kling 1.5 and 1.6 seriously outperform Sora. Even Pika 2.0 sort of does. Google's Veo2 as well, obviously.\n\nI can get consistently good results from the tools mentioned above, but Sora is absolutely horrendous for a flagship video generation tool. How is that even possible?\n\nVeo2 being superior is understandable since Google has a lot of resources, training compute, money. But I doubt Kling and Pika devs have as much resources to train their models compared to OpenAI.\n\nHow?",

      "body": "You want the truth? It's because openai carries the flag of American AI supremacy and people are reluctant to believe china could have an edge even if it does. When sora clips were launched, it was well known that it was cherry picked as hell, and so many skeptics were silenced. News outlets were paid millions to plaster the name \"Sora\" everywhere, even though the product didn't launch for another year. Openai published no papers on the technique not training data because both were stolen, mostly from Google. \n\nYes sora is an inferior product, and that's because it's versatility is limited by the lobotomy and model distillation needed to achieve a good solution. If you think back, dalle was never the sota in image generation for long, but it definately garnered the most media attention. This is openai's endgame. They are not interested in providing the right tools to people, or empower them. They steal from their investors and users alike, all in the name of being the best. \n\nIf there's any solace, openai's biggest threat is illyas SSI. Once they lose their crown jewel and their AGI model is deemed obsolete and redundant in an endless sea of replicatable software, they will scramble to eat as much investor money as possible before they become another \"victim\". \n\nIt's not all doom and gloom though, and they've shown that these models are capable of generality through their o3 arc agi results (which again, remain to be verified by the larger public). The public generally loves them and wants them to do the best and beat the behemoth that is google, but if veo is launched to the broader public and easily accessible in everyone's phone, then their only saving grace becomes the robotic division. \n\nExpect an end of the year update to sora, but they'll never make it the best, just good enough for the market.",

By people who matter, not people like you or me.\n\nThey were able to secure funding that doubled the size of their upcoming system. So, mission accomplished.\n\nThe thing was never going to turn a profit even if it was perfect, the cost was just too high. 'AGI'/ASI and mass production workhorse NPU's built by them were always the prize. Ilya literally was like 'forget marketing, let's go straight to AGI' with his new company.\n\nTry to put yourselves in the shoes of the OpenAI research guys: They have this tens of billions of dollars computer cluster coming up. One question that's at the foremost of their minds: \"What do we do with it?\" If they're not competitive or the first to achieve AGI, their company is as good as dead. Microsoft or Google will take everything. Another tertiary question they think about: \"How do we make sure this thing doesn't kill anyone (without proper permission first)?\"\n\nThey've got about six months to form their plans and contingency plans. Six months to finish up the systems that will be used to train the upcoming systems. Clock's ticking.\n\nEvery moment of their working lives is devoted to *that*, they're not interested in pouring additional hundreds of millions into an incremental improvement to a video generator that'll be obsolete in a week. They're trying to build a *mind* here, and it'll take domain optimizers that cover quite a few different domains to do that.\n\nThe next level of scale will be >60 to >200 times as large as GPT-4. This is the dumbest time to spend limited resources on marketing demos - you do that kind of thing *after* you reach the next tier of scaling and need to show an improvement from the thing.",

I've been generating hundreds of videos across all models since we were just working with open-source stuff like potato1 and zeroscope, then onto Runway, I was a beta tester for Kling before it launched in the west, then Lumalabs, then Pika, then even LeonardoAI which I found particularly cool for some stuff. Runway Gen-3 was the king for a long time, but Sora blows it out of the water for literally everything I can throw at it. \"Sora sucks!\" - no it doesn't, you just don't know how to prompt properly or how to use it properly. I have hundreds of Sora generations at this point which I could show to people and for your average everyday human - 8/10 would not be able to tell it's AI. For consistent 20-second generations, the amount of sheer dynamism that every generation manages to pump out is unparalled. High end fashion videos? Professional marketing videos? Vintage period era clips? Landscape shots? It literally makes me anything I ask of it - 2x720p 20 second variations - 5 of these at once so 10 20 second generations - and I can literally take between 10-15 seconds out of each of those gens and use them for content that looks professional, real, and convincing. I am so so sick of people crying out that it's a shit model when the real barrier is that they just don't test it and actually learn how to use it. All of these tools WORK DIFFERENTLY, and some require a bit more fine-tuning and fiddling with your prompts than others. But once you work out your structure and flow - Sora is unbeatable imo. For txt2video that is. I still think Kling and Hailuo are slightly better for img2video. And no - I'm not talking about Google Veo 2 because a product only available to people in the US on a waitlist - is not a released product in my eyes. At the moment with Sora - I generate 10x720p 20 second generations within about 3-5 minutes. 200 seconds - say even if you're conservative that's like 125-150 seconds of usable video content in 3-5 minutes. It's absolutely mindblowing.",
