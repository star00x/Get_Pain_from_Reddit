      "body": "Ah, the eternal struggle. You mean you *don't* enjoy watching your protagonist spontaneously change their entire facial structure and outfit every 12 frames? Weird.\n\nJokes aside, you've hit on the holy grail of generative video. Complete consistency is still the big challenge, but some platforms are getting surprisingly good at it. Here’s the current lay of the land:\n\n**The User-Friendly Options:**\n\n*   **[Runway](https://runwayml.com/)**: Their Gen-2 model has a specific **Character Preset** feature. You upload a handful of images of your character, it learns their face, and then you can direct that character in new scenes. It's probably the most direct and popular solution for this right now.\n*   **[Pika](https://pika.art/)**: Very similar to Runway, Pika lets you use reference images to guide the generation. Its performance on consistency has improved a ton, and it's a major competitor. You can get decent results by feeding it a consistent character image.\n*   **[Haiper](https://haiper.ai/)**: A newer contender that's been showing some impressive results with character consistency and even simple character animation like making them walk. Worth keeping an eye on.\n\n**The 'I Demand God-Tier Control' Route (Advanced):**\n\n*   This involves more tinkering but gives you the most power. The professional workflow is typically **Stable Diffusion + AnimateDiff**. Here’s the secret sauce:\n    1.  **Create a Character LoRA:** You train a small, lightweight model (called a LoRA) on images of your character. This teaches the AI exactly what your character looks like from multiple angles. Here's a [search link for tutorials](https://google.com/search?q=stable+diffusion+character+lora+tutorial).\n    2.  **Use ControlNets:** To manage scenes and multiple characters, you use ControlNet (especially OpenPose or Depth maps) to define the exact pose, position, and interaction of each character in the frame before you even generate the video.\n\nIt's a much steeper learning curve, but it's how you get shots with two specific, consistent characters interacting in a consistent environment.\n\n**Pro-Tip:** For any of these tools, start by generating a solid \"character sheet\" in Midjourney or Stable Diffusion (front, side, back views, different expressions). Using these as your reference images gives any model a much better chance of success.\n\n*This was an automated and approved bot comment from r/generativeAI.

      "body": "Hi there, I've been experiencing the same problem. I need photorealistic characters and settings - and so far, I've had mostly disappointment and frustration. The route I've tried:\n\n1. Designing a character in Midjourney\n2. Creating a character sheet in LTX - great results, looks realistic. Got 20+ photos.\n3. Training an actor in LTX\n4. Trying to create still images using LTX's storyboard studio - this is where I got into serious problems. When asking for one character in a simple settings, it usually works (not always but I could live with the statistics). When asking for two characters it begins to be very confused. Three characters is virtually impossible. Conclusion: for my needs - this route is useless. I will try other models and hope for better results, but at this point my hopes are kind of low. Anyone had better experience? Please do share.",

I am trying to make a “simple” story using 2d handdrawn old Disney style cartoon of 3-5 min long (only two animal characters interacting - but narrative way of storytelling). Each clip of 5-8 sec. Character consistency between clips has been a major headache. Tried both text to video and image to video and lots of trial and error..still havent found a good way. Tried SORA plus, Flow, whisk, Hailuo. Let me know if anyone has found success in 2d hand-drawn style. Any suggestions for this style?",

      "body": "Absolutely! Keeping both **characters and scenes consistent** in AI video is a big challenge right now, but a few tools are getting closer:\n\n# 🔹 Pika Labs\n\nGreat for artsy, animated clips. Scene consistency is solid, and characters can stay mostly consistent if you use the right prompts. Multi-character shots are possible but limited.\n\n# 🔹 Runway Gen-3\n\nSuper cinematic with great motion and lighting. It’s getting better at keeping the look consistent, but characters can still “drift” across shots.\n\n# 🔹 DeepBrain AI Studios\n\nNot cinematic, but if you want characters that talk (like avatars), it’s perfect. You train your avatar once and it stays consistent in every scene. You can even have two avatars in the same video.\n\n# 🔹 ComfyUI / AnimateDiff setups\n\nIf you’re more hands-on, you can get great consistency with these, especially if you use reference images or storyboards. But it takes a bit of setup.\n\nIf you’re doing full storytelling or skits, you might still need to mix tools. Want a workflow suggestion based on your project type?",

You can upload your own character images, then the characters can stay the same across the video. Just write your story in text, and it’ll break it into scenes and turn it into a short film. I can not sure the scene continuity, but the characters are consistent. I tested it—having three characters in the same shot works perfectly.",
