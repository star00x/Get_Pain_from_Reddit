    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m building a small educational YouTube series and I’m looking for an AI-based animation workflow that keeps character designs consistent across episodes.\n\nThe videos are short (2–3 minutes) and part of a fictional world where I explain language concepts through simple stories and examples. I don’t need anything flashy, just something clean and coherent.\n\nThe problem is that most AI tools I’ve tried keep changing characters slightly between scenes. I’d love something that lets me lock in a character’s appearance and reuse them week to week without having to re-render or fine-tune every shot.\n\nMy goal is to produce one short video per week in about 5–6 hours. I don’t have a high-end PC, so I’m also looking for something that’s either cloud-based or doesn’t kill my laptop.\n\nSooo, are there any AI tools or workflows that actually keep characters consistent and don’t cost a fortune? I’ve looked at things like Animaker and Vyond, but they’re expensive and ugly af.",

I'd like to understand the software chain behind it. \n\nI’m also curious how this works once you’ve already set up a character. Does producing new shots get faster, or do you still spend a lot of time fixing details each time? I’m trying to understand if this workflow becomes manageable over the long run. \n\nIf you ever make a tutorial specifically showing how you build and animate characters in the Leaf & Core style, I would definitely watch it! :D There’s almost no guidance out there on achieving that look while keeping it efficient or I'm not able to find one.",

Add the dialogue.\n\nThen I broke all of the layers down into transparent pngs, got rid of the faces/ recreate them in After Effects and animate the characters with puppet pins and the mouth cycles with joysticks and sliders.\n\nComic + animation would take me about 3-4 hours from start to finish.\n\nNew work contract I've been on since the last comic has been pretty intense so I fell out of the habit and ended up putting time into a new side project.\n\nCrazy thing for me, no matter how much time AI saves, I still don't have enough of it to do everything I'd like to.",
