On this stage I face the first problem: photos look too plastic and visible that they are generated. Also, the character doesn’t look the same I have generated the first time.\nAfter creating 15-25 photos I go training the LoRa, and after training I’m trying to create some consistent content. But, again: too plastic and unrealistic, the face looks different from original. \nAny ideas how to improve the process?🙏",

      "body": "Ah, the classic \"evil twin\" dilemma. You spend hours creating the perfect character, and the AI gives you back their suspiciously smooth-skinned clone from a parallel universe. It's a rite of passage.\n\nYour Midjourney OmniRef -> LoRA workflow is a solid start, but it sounds like you're hitting the uncanny valley wall. Let's get you over it.\n\nHere are a couple of pro-level tricks to add to your process:\n\n*   **Fix The \"Plastic\" Look First:** The main reason for that unrealistic look is often the base generation's lack of texture. Before you even think about training your LoRA, you can significantly improve your source images. A popular technique is to run your best generations through a realism enhancer to fix things like skin texture and pores. This fantastic, in-depth guide by Sirio breaks down a full professional workflow, including using tools specifically for this purpose. Trust me, it's a game-changer.\n    *   **Full Pro Workflow Video:** [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi_ubF8_n8A)\n\n*   **Graduate to a More Powerful Workflow:** For the kind of control you're looking for, many artists move from all-in-one tools to a node-based system like **ComfyUI**. It has a steeper learning curve, but it allows you to chain specific models, upscalers, and face-detailing nodes together. This gives you granular control to lock down your character's likeness across different poses, lighting, and expressions. The video linked above also covers a ComfyUI approach for this exact problem.\n\n*   **Create a \"Character Bible\":** A brilliant and simple trick is to get *insanely* detailed with your character description *before* you generate any images. Use ChatGPT to build a \"character sheet\" that describes bone structure, skin undertones, specific facial features, etc. You then use this highly detailed prompt as the core for all your subsequent generations. This helps keep the AI on a much tighter leash.\n    *   **Tutorial on Creating Character Sheets:** [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4cW77-_Q7I&pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD)\n\nThe key is to give the AI a much more constrained set of rules, both with your initial prompts and the quality of your training data. A little more work on the front end will save you a ton of frustration with inconsistent, waxy-looking results. Godspeed!\n\n*This was an automated and approved bot comment from r/generativeAI.

      "body": "I am probably going to make this sound way more complicated than it is because I suck at explaining stuff, but if you're willing to use a few different tools, here's my process for creating a character LoRA that has nearly perfect consistency.\n\nTools needed:\n\n* I use [Stable Diffusion Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge), but you can use [ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/) or whatever image generator works best for you.\n* [Rope Next](https://github.com/lodgecku/Rope-next)\n* [Kohya ss](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss)\n* Photoshop/Krita/Gimp or some other image editing tool.\n\n1. In Stable Diffusion (or whatever tool you're using), generate one good detailed 1024x1024 close-up face portrait of your character. You only need this one face portrait, so go hard on the details here with eye color, freckles, scars, bone structure, etc. Make the expression neutral. Once you have the character look you want, save it and set it aside.\n2. Generate 40 images with a more general character description with various perspectives, poses, outfits, and backgrounds. My go-to is 30 mid-shot/upper body images, 5 full body, and 5 more close-up face portraits. Don't worry about the face details too much here, just get the general look right with their hair and body. Use in-paint to make sure hands and other details are good.\n3. Use Rope-Next to face-swap that one good 1024x1024 portrait onto those 40 generated images. Play with the settings and see what works best.\n4. 4. (optional but recommended) You may want to do a little Photoshop/Krita/Gimp editing, just to make sure you don't have weird artifacts that might poison your LoRA.\n5. 5. Once all 40 of those images have their faces swapped and look good, you now have a solid training dataset for Kohya ss, where you can train your LoRA. Caption and train as usual.\n\nIt sounds like a lot more work than it is, but it really isn't. \n\n*EDIT - Sorry but I am having a bitch of a time these days and I can't make a video of it.*",

      "body": "This is literally the core challenge we deal with at BetterPic every single day. That plastic look and inconsistency? Yeah, it's why we ended up hiring a 24/7 team of human editors to fix AI hallucinations before photos go out.\n\nThe brutal truth is that pure AI consistency is still pretty broken, especially for faces. Even with LoRA training, you're fighting against models that want to \"interpret\" rather than replicate exactly.\n\nFew things that might help your process:\n\nYour reference images matter way more than you think. If they have inconsistent lighting, angles, or even slightly different facial expressions, the model gets confused and starts inventing details. I'd try using more controlled reference shots - same lighting setup, neutral expressions.\n\nFor the plastic look - that usually comes from over-processing or the model trying too hard to \"perfect\" skin texture.  Sometimes it has to do with your input, are they using beauty filters, blurry, or low lighting, which is hard to pinpoint since every platform handles things differently.\n\nThe LoRA training part is tricky. 15-25 photos might not be enough, but more importantly, the quality and consistency of your training data matters more than quantity. We've found that having too much variation in the training set actually makes consistency worse.\n\nHonestly though? This is exactly why we built our editing pipeline the way we did. Sometimes the most practical solution is accepting that AI gets you 80% there and having humans handle the final 20% for realism.",
