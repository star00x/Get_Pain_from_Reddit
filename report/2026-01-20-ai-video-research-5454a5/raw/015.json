Because of the nature of the work and the problem with deep fakes, manipulations, and other severe problems that are being addressed, more than likely this will be an audio disclaim with that must be clear and the present.\n\nHere are a few examples of deepfakes doing real world damage: \n\nhttps://incode.com/blog/25-million-deepfake-fraud-hong-kong/\n\nhttps://incode.com/blog/top-5-cases-of-ai-deepfake-fraud-from-2024-exposed/#:~:text=An%20AI%2Dmanipulated%20audio%20clip,the%20World's%20Biggest%20Advertising%20Groups\n\nThere are other nefarious uses for it, some even suggesting that it could be used by governments and police to manufacture criminal activity as a means of getting rid of people they don't want that might be causing \"political disturbances\" or \"uncomfortable situations\". This technology can be very dangerous without very aggressive regulations, the problem is, we already know the government's always consider themselves above the law along with 90% of most politicians and elitists.\n\nEuropean Union legislation addressing AI issues:\n\nhttps://www.bioid.com/2024/06/03/eu-ai-act-deepfake-regulations/#:~:text=Developers%20and%20users%20of%20deepfake,classification%20and%20watermarking%20of%20deepfakes.\n\nWhether or not this framework actually does anything beneficial for the people that have the power and the money to abuse it is yet to be seen. There's also the question of the media faking and manipulating news stories just for publicity or exclusives in advertising money. There have been many different scenarios suggested all of which have a huge amount of financial gain, as the above examples demonstrate. \n\nDenmark is already starting to make it into a framework for their legal system that you are representation of your body is automatically copyrighted to prevent anything one from using your body as a means of artificial intelligence rendering or generation. At first this didn't make sense but when you consider how pervasive and dangerous this technology is becoming particularly in the hands of government, it actually does make sense.\n\nFrom the purest legal standpoint of what the EU has started, I would not be surprised if any human representation in AI generated form that isn't explicitly labeled as frictional content, will actually carry heavy criminal penalties.",
