    "selftext": "**Why disappointing?**\n\nI have used Sora on the Pro plan for a whole month before and it completely changed my mind on what AI image to video can do. Yes I know people are disappointed with Sora as well. But when it comes to animating things Sora is #1 no questions asked. It just can recognise things other video models can’t. Give it a hardly recognisable character in an image, like a rocky character in a foggy forest scene and it will still recognise the character, understand that I want it to move, and move it. It has a steep learning curve and most people fail to get what they want but once you get the hang of it you become unstoppable. Another reason to be disappointed is that after months and months of delaying the release of the model, Runway released a model that is still relatively worse than Kling!  Like seriously? Then why we waited this long? Is runway struggling in upgrading their models?\n\n**As why it’s better than nothing?**\n\nWell, because it is. There is a remarkable improvement compared to Gen-3, a significant improvement I would say, they are getting closer to the level of Kling and Sora but not yet.\n\n**Overall, I am happy with the release of Gen-4 but was hoping for more!**\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

That said, I’d humbly disagree with some of your points. Gen-4, when used with the right structure and approach, can deliver really strong results, even in more complex or atmospheric scenes.\n\nIf you're open to it, I’d love to invite you to the [**Runway Discord**](https://discord.gg/RunwayML). There are a lot of creators sharing Gen-4 workflows, demos, and prompt setups that might surprise you. Sometimes it’s just about learning what makes this particular model tick—and once you do, it really opens up.\n\nWould be awesome to see what you’re creating and dig in deeper with you there! 🙌",

Sora on the one hand has amazing capabilities but is a) overpriced (for a 1080p version without a watermark) and b) is terrible at img2vid.

Before using it, I was quite happy with runway, back then, I subscribed to chatgpt pro for the unlimited use of o1 and o1-pro not for Sora, so Sora was like a bonus to me. I say this despite the fact that I'm not fond of OpenAI, and I don't even have a subscription with them anymore not even the cheap plus one. \n\nBut Sora needs to be dealt in a unique way that's different from any another model you can think of. It's not intuitive so I'm not surprised most users don't like the experience but as I said, knowing how to unlock its potential is like entering a different realm of AI video generations.\n\nAs for Gen-4, I kinda like it, it's good enough for the price if you are a heavy user on the unlimited plan, Kling might be relatively better but costs can easily add up with heavy use. So with Gen-4, Runway could be fairly ranked among the top 3 but definitely not on the top.",

That is, once they get going. For some reason with Gen 4 the first three or four seconds of a ten second video the character will often remain motionless, then the prompt will kick in and they go nuts. \n\nHowever, there are a lot of features yet to be released for Gen 4 such as last frame and camera controls, so we’ll see.
