    "title": "I built a fully automated AI video factory. Here's the Make + AI workflow",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been working on a system to automate video creation and publishing from start to finish. The goal was to build a hands-free pipeline that could generate and post content to YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok without me touching a thing.\n\nThis is a pretty advanced workflow, but I wanted to share the high-level architecture.\n\nHere’s how the AI video factory works:\n\nIdeation Engine (ChatGPT + Google Sheets): The process starts in ChatGPT. I use a custom prompt to generate a batch of video ideas, titles, and captions for a specific niche (e.g., \"Disney characters in 80s style\"). I then paste this list into a Google Sheet, which acts as the content queue for the automation.\n\nImage Generation (PIAPI - Flux Model): The Make workflow triggers on a new row in the Google Sheet. It takes the prompt and sends it to an AI image model called \"Flux\" via the PIAPI service to generate the initial high-quality visual.\n\nVideo Generation (PIAPI - Kling Model): The image generated in the last step is then sent to another AI model called \"Kling\". This model takes the image and a motion prompt to turn the static visual into a short video clip.\n\nVideo Assembly (JSON2Video): To add music and structure, the workflow uses a service called JSON2Video. It sends the AI-generated video clip and a background audio track (from Dropbox) to the service, which combines them based on a pre-defined template.\n\nDistribution: Once the final video is rendered, the workflow automatically uploads it to Dropbox, marks the video as \"done\" in the Google Sheet, and then posts it to YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok with the title and caption from the sheet.\n\nIt's a complex setup, but it's incredible to see it run. It's a true, end-to-end content creation and distribution pipeline.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about the different services used or the Make setup!\n\nOpen to work if you need any types of workflows \n\n",
