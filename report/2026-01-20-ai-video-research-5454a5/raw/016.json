    "title": "What's your take on AI-generated video? Useful? Useless? Somewhere in between?",
    "selftext": "Hi all. Jason from Adobe here. Over the last few weeks I've been down multiple rabbit holes around AI video (a combination of agentic/assisted technologies, along with all the various offerings in the generative world) and the communities seem very divided, maybe even neutral at this point, on the 'threats of generative AI' that seemed so prevalent even a few months ago.\n\nSo my question to you is: **what do you think about generated video, in general?**\n\n(and just to clarify; *this isn't Firefly specific*, but any/all video models out there)\n\nIs there \\*any\\* use case (now or in the near future) where you see yourself embracing it? Are there any particular models or technologies that are more/less appealing? This would include things like AI upscaling/restoration tech, or other 'helper-type' tools.\n\nWe've all seen the <now named> 'AI slop' that shows up on social (X, Insta, etc) ... and don't hold back on your opinions around that stuff... but in general, I think this community sees it for what it is --- just kinda meh and not a threat.  But outside of generating for generating's sake... do you see value in using/working with generative video and its associated tech?\n\nLet's go deep on this! (and if I haven't made it clear, I'm definitely in the middle. I don't hate it, I don't use a lot of (purely generative) video, I can appreciate it <in select example>, but I see definitely potential in some areas, and I'm interested where you see gaps or possibilities. Thanks as always.",

      "body": "The only real thing I've seen AI be genuinely useful for is transcripting, and is probably the one thing I'd like out of premiere the most. Premiere's current automatic transcript generation is seriously lacking. It capitalizes random words and doesn't understand when people are actually done talking. I've seen other programs use some form of AI to enhance transcription and it saves me a massive headache, I'd love to see it be implemented in some way.\n\nHowever, when it comes to AI-video generation, I can't say I see any use case for it, in really any way. I had a shot that unfortunately cut a little before we wanted, so we tried using the generative extend tool to get a few more seconds out of it, and it was absolutely unusable. It muddied the footage and was immediately noticable as AI generated. I haven't touched the feature since.\n\nMy issue with AI (beyond it's environmental and ethical/moral implications) is mainly on it being shoved into programs with little real use case that isn't either far too expensive and just as time consuming as doing it yourself, or immediately instills a new form of uncanny valley within me and everyone who sees it. It can be wildly useful and I'll admit I actually think it's kind of cool, but until we can find a way to implement it as a tool without using a massive amount of energy, as well as find more use cases beyond \"I made a video of Barrack Obama getting arrested isn't that funny,\" I don't really see any reason to go near AI-video generation.\n\nIt feels like those people in the 90s with giant VR headsets, except they decided to immediately begin putting those on the shelves and stake entire ways of life on them. This technology is many, many years away from actually having a reason to exist that doesn't create far more harm than it eliminates.\n\nFinally, regulate AI. With the direction we are heading we need serious laws for this shit.",

You cant crop away those captions that are near the dang middle of the video.\n\nAlso, I often get still images, which I turn into video by doing some Ken Burns type effect. AI can enhance this with more rotation/bullet time and 2.5D effects.\n\nAnother one is morph animations, morphing from the last frame of previous video to the first frame of the next one. Can look great when you pull it off. To supplement our existing morphing options.\n\nAlso, object removal and auto-rotoscope. Nice to have for quick and dirty social media work.\n\nThe thing is, a half ass implementation is useless. It must be best in class, or as good as the best out there. If it just creates jittery nightmare fuel, then I won't use it at all. \n\nAlso, a stable platform with quality of life improvements is much more important to me than any AI feature.",

This is ofcourse with the thought in mind that if Adobe were tondo this the models would need to be trained on licensed data etc etc. Same thing you did with firefly in order to compensate original creators of the training data.\n\nThat aside.\nGenerated video is great for quick animated storyboarding or concepting.\nSometimes it can even be useful when you are looking for a certain piece of stock footage and cant find it; you use a generated clip instead. Not ideal but yeah..\n\nThen Ai tools can just be massively helpful in post. \n-Ai subject cutout tools instead of roto/masking.\n-Enhancers & upscalers\n-Ai powered 'filters' in lumetri (yes i know how that sounds but come on. If everything in my timeline can be graded like an 80's vhs tape recorder with a prompt instead of having to do lumetri cc and a bunch of adjustment layers and distortions/scratch layers that'd be a massive time saver.)\n-Ai powered dialogue editing tools. Much quicker to have ai change someones sentence & according facial expressions then having to replan a shoot, rehire models and crew etc. Same with making different spoken language versions. For instance video X needs to be launched in english, spanich and chinese speaking countries but the model on set only speaks 1 of them. Can have Ai translate the audio to a different language while keeping vocal character and tone & have the facial muscles match the new language.\n\nSo yeah bit in between i guess.\n\nThere are some really cool things that can be done if done well (and ethically).",

Most of that time I’ve never worked on anything where gen AI would be useful at all so it was a lot easier to be disdainful or disinterested in it, but I did just start a new job in UA and honestly, sometimes the gen AI stuff comes in pretty clutch, and my feelings about it have softened.  \n\nFor context, UA requires pumping a boat-load of content into the system in the hopes that something works and the “algorithm” these ad delivery services use starts to push the ad. Most of the time the ads immediately drop to nothing. That means you can’t invest very heavily into any given ad.\n\nSo, need something goofy like a cat walking around dressed up, eating sushi? We aren’t going to hire a cat trainer, etc. to do that, but we can generate one or two goofball shots with a goofy tagline and boom. There’s one of the 8 UA ads I need to deliver every week.  \n\nThat video would never be made in a non gen-AI word (and many people might say the world would be better for it, lol. Maybe true!) I didn’t put anyone out of work - at least directly - by making that ad, and I still had editors who did the generations/prompting, music, sound design, motion and end cards.  \n\nWe do a similar thing with stock video. So it’s like another offshoot of that.  \n\nNow, I can’t say our AI gens would never have a more direct impact on us hiring actors for shoots (which we also do), but it’s undeniably useful to our team.  \n\nAnd as much as we all want to say “screw that AI slop, I’d never touch that crap…” an AI-generated cat eating sushi with chopsticks beat out probably the last 50 ads we made featuring actors, motion design, 3D, etc. Some of that might be just luck or creative savvy, but the *audience* is also clearly enjoying this stuff, regardless of what our opinions are. ",

That being said, a lot of video shit with AI is either useless or far from being useful right now. I believe the best use right now and stuff to focus on is upscaling, better fps interpolation, and small patchwork stuff that just saves time for editors rather than replaces work.\n\n\nOther than that the coolest uses I've seen was using AI for cool VFX like some of the stuff on higgsfield. Their earth zoom out, glowy shit, etc. This is stuff that is possible to do already with editing tools but is really tedious and the barrier for entry is quite high. AI in that use case allows for more creative shit being done rather than creative shit being taken away.\n\n\nOverall, I think less of a focus on complete AI generated videos (already tools for that, often quite disliked anyways), and more of a focus on time-saving or enhancing is better.",

      "body": "Hey Jason, I appreciate the initiative of crowd sourcing on more philosophical concepts here. I'm seeing a lot of aggression in the comments, and while I understand their grievances, I can't help but feel like everybody's just feeling a bit insecure about the state of video editing, and content creation in general, which I, in general, partially share.\n\nMy take on AI-generated video as a whole is that we haven't begun to comprehend the potential use cases moving into the future. When photography was invented, it replaced painters whose careers were based on creating lifelike portraits of people. But painters kept painting, and surrealism and impressionism were born out of the changing landscape. I am excited to see where we as human artists go from here, but we will all have to adapt and be smart, or our jobs will become redundant. Nothing will ever replace human creativity, because by definition, only we can innovate ways to express what it's like to live this life.\n\nNow, as it currently stands, I've been finding much of the AI-generated video content pretty useless, especially as stock content, because it is all transparently slop. That being said, I have used the new Premiere function to extend clips a couple seconds, and it's actually been very useful. If you inspect carefully, it's still obvious that it's AI, but if the source material of the clip is there to reference, you can't really tell. As we move forward, and the tech becomes better, I can see AI-gen video being a great replacement for stock footage, which is an un-creative, annoying chore to find and use anyway--even though it will put stock videographers/photographers out of work (but that's just the way of the world). Custom AI stock footage will potentially be much better. AI will also really help with amateur (and professional, I suppose) CGI, especially where we fill in gaps in the background, or improve world building (ie. *Mad Max: Fury Road*, and *Joker*). And the obvious one, is where low-quality shitposters out there who are trying to use content creation as a means of profit, instead of a source of creativity, will use plenty of AI to create more of what the industry as deemed \"slop.\" But just because they are using it doesn't remove the potential creative possibilities for genuine creatives. The fear is that it will seep into being used instead of real footage for narratives, which would normally require an entire crew and actors, and for editorial purposes, where authenticity and realness is absolutely essential. We will have to create safeguards, both through union deals, and software identifiers. I work largely in commercial work, and to be honest, as a consumer I don't really care philosophically if brands use AI for their commercials. It just seems completely inevitable that brands would cut corners like that, as sad as that is for all of the workers.\n\nThanks for listening to my TED Talk, Jason!",

Very soon I realized that I was not going to be able to just use the generated videos as they were (no much control over camera movement, composition, etc) so I decided to just use Photoshop to create the frame references with a green background for keying and composite the elements in After Effects later. It basically became a game of creating references and trying prompts until I had an asset that I could use, and I still had to mask, freeze frames or tweak a lot of things in After Effects.\n\nI like to have control over every element on a project (as most directors or art directors would) so using AI generated videos for individual assets instead of trying to make it generate the whole thing was a better approach for the kind of projects I work on. I still couldn't generate everything I needed so I had to combine generated videos with traditional layers and key frames.\n\nI don't expect to use AI generated videos on every project any time soon.

I'm often having to convert 16x9 content to 9x16 and blowing up a 2.35 picture kills me inside, but also looks terrible. Still wouldn't be able to use any of this tech on film/tv content, but for other things - like interviews - it could be helpful.

I don't love the idea - one more industry for AI to destroy - but that seems like an obvious fit. (Please let this not happen to production music - I can't handle that). I can also see it being used in pitch videos/rip-o-matic sizzles eventually.\n\nGenerally I'm of the opinion that anything that's fully AI generated isn't art - full stop.

When applied to full product shots, the text on my product became gibberish and inconsistent. That said, when used in the right context, AI-generated video can offer minor support—particularly as a low-cost VFX option (I was using Firefly Video Beta at the time).\n\nUntil it reaches a level where it can accurately reproduce elements like logos, patterns, and text as they actually appear (or at least closely resemble the original), I don't believe AI-generated video will be viable for full-scale commercial use.\n\nSince this is a Premiere-focused group, what I’m really hoping for is the integration of AI-generated tools as a kind of \"stamp tool\" and tracking feature in video editing. Even if the footage needs to be nested first (like the drama of warp stabilizer + speed ramp), that’s acceptable.\n\nIt would also be helpful to see AI-powered subject tracking—similar to what DaVinci Resolve currently offers.

But they take the time to write stories, script, and create something different out of it. Take channels like Neural Viz on YouTube for example.     \nBut for professional video producers and editors, my hope is that it will become just another tool. Is your shot a few frames too short? Did you lose focus for just a moment? Did a random bug fly into your shot?

      "body": "I work as a digital content producer for an HGTV show, and the production company has asked me on several occasions to start using AI to edit and reduce our need for outsourcing edits because EPs and non-post team members just see what filters to them on social media. \n\nCurrently it seems like AIs can make clips from long format, or transcribe and edit a podcast to take out dead space and swap camera angles, but it's pretty trash when we try to use it from raw footage.  If I film with talent for 5-10 minutes, the AI isn't able to deduce good takes from bad, what broll to connect with shots, what to make of off camera direction of talent, or ensure the critical information like brand contributors key words are included (it just requires me to go back and edit in all that stuff anyways) so it's really not helping my workflow from a video editing perspective, it's just kind of pushing out slop.  \n\nI've also warned them that the popularity of our personalities is largely based on trust, confidence, and feeling of -human- connection - that idea the host is 'someone I could do a project/have a beer/hang out with' and the minute viewers detect AI it will become an alienating force that robs our brand of credibility.  But that's all from a storytelling/parasocial relationship side.  There are some things I'm using AI for that really do help. \n\nI love the remix feature, I'm not a talented beat editor, and it's quick, clean, and good enough for BG music.  Any automated  features that can help speed up non-story work like: noisy audio cleanup. I'd love a tool if it could help me nail colour correction (I need lots of help there).  I use AI removal tools in Photoshop and Lightroom A LOT - denoising, object removal (the PAs really outta be cleaning up coffee cups) so it's not ALL bad - but it's just not the silver bullet for productivity that's being hyped out there. \n\nA lot of that isn't entirely GENERATIVE, I know - but the hurdle for me would be replacing a known talent's screen time with anything AI, and still being considered trustworthy.  I'd love to be able to use it for simple animations.  I'd love to be able to use it to help with motion graphics.  I can't trust it to know how to present a character properly following all the safety precautions we need to follow on a construction site.  But I think when it comes to HGTV programming, there's 'houses like mine' or aspirational 'houses of the really effing rich' - but I don't AI replacing the guy who makes our walkthrough graphics any time soon, and while 'choose your AI generated house' posts on IG are fun enough, I can't see it replacing our shows relating to real people in actual time and space.  I just think it would blow our relationship with the audience, and we'd lose them entirely.  Hell, our cable programming is already losing the fight to your laptop and cellphone as everyone 3-screens their attention to death. \n\nI can't remember who said it but Generative needs to answer this question most of all: \n\n\"If I can't be bothered to make it, why should anyone be bothered to watch it?\"",

      "body": "Long story short: I'm kind of OK using generative AI video in some corporate videos, and perhaps for re-creations in documentaries. And I've done some experiments. For example:\n\n\\*\\*We wanted an establishing aerial shot of a hospital's campus, but it's located in a no-fly zone for drones. So we tried some image-to-video generators...Didn't get a shot that worked for us. Was that due to our not-great skills, the current state of GenAI tools (this was six months ago), both? In the end, we did a fairly typical wide street-level nighttime to daytime time-lapse (but without the foreboding Koyaanisqatsi soundtrack). So in that case, GenAI helped us see that going for a different shot was the thing to do.\n\n\\*\\*I also want a golden-hour off-shore drone shot of Davenport California (on the Pacific coast north of Santa Cruz). But it's so often overcast there. I recall this short clip from the Sora rollout last year; it gets close to what I'd like (but wrong location): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCvTNR4y4Bo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCvTNR4y4Bo)   I don't think I'll use a GenAI shot for what I want, but I do periodically try with different GenAI tools, mainly to see the state of the tools when trying to re-create real locations and giving the prompter (\"creator\" doesn't seem like the right term) control over lighting, water, camera move, etc).\n\n\\*\\*I also worked on a project where we created a moving sequence of a company's \"humble beginnings\" from old photos. We stylized it a lot so it's pretty clearly generated video, but we could have made it way less obvious that we used GenAI. Ya, that's worrisome.\n\n\\*\\*For documentaries, I've messed around with trying to build re-creations of an event from 200 years ago (that would be clearly a re-creation). I haven't been able to get the control I want for a good narrative sequence (the \"humble beginnings\" sequence wasn't really narrative), but in a month or two? Who knows? Why GenAI for re-creations? It's cheaper and faster than doing them in the real world with real people. :-/ But again, I didn't get anything that I'd want to include in the film. HOWEVER, the results have been good enough to function as sort of an animatic that's helped me figure out how long that sequence should run, a sense of the shots I'd need, and stuff like that. So like storyboards and pre-vis for someone who's not great at drawing.\n\nBut I use AI tools for transcription, for audio post (e.g., noise reduction), for some image work (e.g., Topaz, generative fill)... However, 20+ years ago, I had a conversation with a friend at a leading public-affairs series; his team decided that  interviews could not have morph cuts (with Elastic Reality and Avid at the time, IIRC); their thought was that morph cuts hid that there was an edit and a break in time. I roll with that limitation in journalism and docs. But not so much in corporate. So what's the line on what's acceptable and what isn't?\n\nI think the Archival Producers Alliance has some good resources on at least some of these issues. Have you seen their guidelines, Best Practices for Use of Generative AI in Documentaries? IIRC, they want to keep updating the guide to reflect the high-speed changes in the AI world. They'll be at the Association of Moving Image Archivists conference in December (and AMIA is a great group). [https://www.archivalproducersalliance.com/apa-genai-initiative](https://www.archivalproducersalliance.com/apa-genai-initiative)\n\nI could go on and on and on about this stuff. As could we all.\n\nGreat question, Jason. Great comments, everyone.",

Nobody got time for that. Yesterday I asked one of our graphic artists if the Adobe AI could possibly change the text on a card in a shot we want to use. Good news, bad news: it will change the text just not to what we need it to say, SMH.\n\nI just need Premiere to work really well. As a matter of fact, I'm on a call with Adobe tomorrow about a handful of stability and playback issues that we've been struggling with for years now. Across two different studio build outs we still have the same problems. So, I appreciate the new features. Maybe some day I'll have time to try them, but for now it just needs to work.\n\nAnd, you know, credit where it's due, I get lots of work done with Adobe products.

The first AI video was novel and fun to watch but the more it's progressed, the less interesting it's become to me. To the point that AI video slop now actively pisses me off.

Just a couple frames of de-synch of audio with a talking head has people screaming AI even though it is all very real, just the timing is off a bit.  Viewers don't want to watch generative content, and any creator caught (or even just suspected of) using it, they are primed to be soft-canceled.\n\nThere are very real and legitimate uses of AI, but all this effort being put into generative stuff just feels like a massive mal-investment to me, and I'm just waiting for that bubble to pop.

I kind of think you’re being very “friendly” here because you know people will scream about AI. But Adobe Premiere generative extend is a game changer once it can work at 4K, and keep fidelity or work on nests. That being said, they won’t fix the masking tool because they want you to use after effects, timewarp and position/scale can’t be used at the same time accurately. With gen extend I could erase an eye blink that starts right before an edit or if the person starts to talk and I need them to just pause for one beat, one gen extend has better quality it will make some things sooooo much easier. You know how many times I’ve tracked in an open eye for 4 frames? \n\nActually, fuck it, give us Nulls in premier so I can link video clips together. You could literally just shove a bunch of After Effects tools into premier. In the settings you could choose how much to expose. Everyone I know has PTSD from Dynamic Link and will never use it. It causes issues with making back up files. It’s supposed to simplify but it just complicates. \n\nBack to AI, the fact that Adobe has been so AI forward is great. I was amazing when PS had gen tools before most people even knew what midjourney was. The people that hate AI haven’t used it enough to know how amazing it is. Topaz has a starlight model that runs on your own computer, speaking of environmental issues. I mean at that point just go live in a cave. We’re not talking about putting lead in gasoline, plus the entire planet has basically given up on doing anything about climate change. Data centers don’t pollute water, they just temporarily hold it. \n\nIt only bugs me that people hate it so much because I feel like they’re missing out on something awesome. And it makes me question my sanity. How can something so awesome just be considered garbage by others? Again survivorship basis. Only the book covers that are obviously AI get called out.

A.I. might just be the great equalizer in the world.  \n\nI see a lot of oversaturation. Like youtube is now, but probably worse. How many good videos are there now that aren't getting many views.  Things get lost in the noise.  If you have 100x times more content creators, there just that much more noise blocking out the top stuff.\n\nWhere does that leave Adobe? I mean, Adobe is the tool for the professional.  What happens when the professional becomes obsolete?  A.I. is coming. There's no stopping it. Does Adobe embrace it and lead the way, or let another company smother them out? Who knows.  The bitch of it is that if Adobe does fully embrace it, the professionals who do use it and pay for it might get so bent out of shape over it, that it could really hurt the company before they become AI visual leaders.

I think its ability to make convincing fakes without vfx experience is dangerous. Plus, I don’t think it makes the job of the editor any easier or any more lucrative. I would prefer it if adobe divested away from ai, and spent more time making their tools more stable. I would also prefer my “obsolete” tools be restored, rather than fully removed in new versions.\n\nEdit: Thank you btw for asking a follow up. I appreciate that.",

      "body": "Personally, over time I have gone from curious to getting increasingly hardened in a negative opinion.'\n\nThe foundational work on modern generative AI was largely done on stolen content, so I find all the subsequent work unethical even if a specific model was trained on legit content.  Every time somebody announces a new benchmark in generated content, I see it 100% through a lens of abuse cases.  Scammers and abusers are absolutely flourishing with every new announcement.  There's increasing amounts of stuff like involuntary sexual content based on real people.  Artists are being pushed aside in favor of generating _content_ that doesn't mean anything.  \n\nYou mention that you are from Adobe, and honestly I find myself often frustrated with pretty work-a-day workflow features in Premiere that haven't been touched in _years_ while the company has focused so many resources on stuff that I find anywhere from useless to actively offensive.  So for every flashy feature focused on the hype cycle, I see multicam sync being apparently pretty much abandoned.  Who needs to sync a boom mic track anyway, when you are supposed to just throw some AI at the camera scratch audio, right?\n\nI know that a lot of people who are enthusiastic about the new AI stuff will be as dismissive of me as I am of the AI stuff, and call me a regressive luddite.  But most of my career has been in tech.    I'm not anti-technology in any general sense.  And I'm not particularly ignorant of the topic.  I started out optimistic and curious, going back a few years when I wasn't being hounded by this stuff every day.  My opinion has only gotten hardened into the negative from exposure and experience, not from inexperience.\n\nDump it all in a garbage fire, and let me have software that works well for what I tell it to do.  At this point I'd give a finger off my hand to go just one week without being hounded by some vendor trying to bash some new AI thing down my throat, because their internal politics have decided it's a project that is too big to fail, so they are going all dark patterns to goose engagement stats.  Every time a vendor announces a new AI thing and advertises the implementation detail of AI as an inherent virtue, I lose some respect for that vendor.  Sell features and benefits.  If your advertising says \"AI, AI, AI,\" I am forced to conclude the vendor can't articulate any actual benefit.",

For me, if that can save a shot or so, it's more than welcomed. All time saving tools are welcomed.\n\n\nRegarding generative content, my team had small successes applying it to do some fill effects in product videos, we already played with ebsynth before, and we still do due to it's efficiency vs ai generation. And recently I confess I was astonished with Veo and Hunyuan but that's really it. \n\n\nThe thing is, I honestly don't feel great when using those tools. But we don't want to lag behind. I've seen some great storytelling AI channels, not the usual ai slop, and I'm kinda ok with it, but call me old-fashioned, I love the craft, the idea of building something from the ground with your efforts. AI kinda steals the flavour. ",

Sometimes I'll use it remove noise in order to pull a better key from a matte etc. -\n\nUpscaling/denoising would be great. Most of the content I work with is based around teaching electronics. So until AI can replicate \"Solder green a jumper wire to Pin 7 of the Xiao RP2040 shown from a 3/4 view at a distance of 3\"\" It's going to be easier to just film it.\n\nConsistency is really important too - the tools, hardware, and elements should all be consistent throughout the video.

Shot tracking stays solid because I keep the metadata from the original clip. Workflows move faster if every AI layer gets its own track and a \\_GEN suffix so the team can swap it out when standards change. I’ve tested Topaz Video AI and Runway, but AdComposer AI mostly rides shotgun when I need tight social copy that lines up with the finished cuts.

I recently played with, despite being one of the grumpy old farts who automatically defaults to avoiding most of the AI stuff.  I wanted to see if the actor had said a line a certain way in any of the takes.  Premiere had transcribed the files, so theoretically easy.  But I had to click on each file, one by one, to search the transcripts separately.\n\nIf I was using a computer from the 1980's and I had a directory full of text files that I wanted to search for a phrase, I could do that in two seconds even if there were a zillion files.  The UX for the AI stuff seems to be rushed out and clunky, and they skip over kind of basic already-solved stuff that I would expect to be easy on a 40 year old computer, to implement the really fancy stuff.  The AI model doing the speech recognition was generally pretty good.  The transcript itself on any given file was fine to good.  (It would be better if I could easily point it at the text of the screenplay as a word source for the recognition dictionary!  Narrowed model speech recognition worked perfectly fine in the 1990's, even with unique sci fi jargon.)  But the focus 100% on the \"sexy\" AI guts part, and the UX for stuff like \"search and filter text\" gets a back seat because that doesn't generate hype.  It just gets bolted on from an implementation-first orientation, and not thought about from use-case-first orientation.",

      "body": "What Adobe needs to do is focus on giving creatives and professionals tools to help us do our work. People matter. I like what Rick Rubin says about AI. “It has no point of view”— AI generated video and images are utter crap. Everything I’ve tried with it gets taken out of the final unless it is something like texture or a pattern that can be woven into a transition, or a title maybe. It is wasted processing power. The only upside i see is that maybe it will be like porn and the great incentives the old step-sister  brought to bear on bandwidth and resolution- heck anything related to the Internet was put into light speed by coomers willing to pay extra to get better faster sharper variety every night. AI might do that for us with off site processing power so we can start cooking with actually useful production tools. Autopod is a beast, I will say that. Is that even AI?",

I think about the viral video of the cats doing the Olympic diving or maybe some of the really off the wall Veo 3 videos. I can also see it being useful for pre-production. Maybe they can help fill in some gaps with pickup shots.\n\nI don’t like the idea of it replacing human performances, or things like the food hero shots in ads and stuff. Not just because of the job implications for many, but I think it’s very very disingenuous. I think people resonate with things that are real and I think no matter how photorealistic AI gets, it will come with a feeling that will be hard to shake. People have complained about food in commercials not looking like what they actually get. AI will certainly make that worse.\n\nTechnically speaking, AI video often comes baked in with a look, like a creative lut is burned into it. In order to even use it for cutaway shots or maybe establishing shots for a short, we need a log space to work in.",

To your question, I'd say it's pretty evenly split in that demographic as well, but it rather depends on what tools you're talking about. ChatGPT, Topaz (in a variety of their modules) even ElevenLabs (to some degree) in general seem to have fairly universal appeal. That's not definitive, of course. And this would include things like Ai transcription/captioning too I believe. On the purely generative front, it's definitely a conversation to be had, because some are super on-board (and I've met with some filmmakers in this space) and their work is, frankly, pretty new and spectacular.  But that doesn't discount the fact that while there's still an enormous degree of manual input, genAI is a driver behind the visuals for sure. And then there's the other side which would rather stay away. It's a really interesting time in the space, that's for sure.",

      "body": "I use AI for work.\n\nI make training videos for the home service trades- HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical and Roofing. There are often unique visual scenarios I need to get my point across. For example, as part of a lesson for roofers about inspecting for leaks and the potential  damage that water can cause, I needed a video of a ceiling collapsing as seen from inside the house.\n\nIt took four or five tries so it didn't look goofy and to not make a version where one couch suddenly turned into three couches when the water hit the floor, but we got there.\n\nI like AI video creation for a couple of highly specific reasons (based on my admittedly unique needs):\n\n\\- Most stock video is created outside the US, which is normally not an issue, but electrical plugs, uniforms, architecture, vehicles, money, etc. are usually different enough that I can't use them for my North American audience. AI lets me create scenes that better reflect what my audience might encounter in the US and Canada.\n\n\\- 100% of my audience works on residential repairs, not corporate or commercial jobs. As a result, they ***never*** wear hard hats or reflective vests. Stock photos and video almost always show contractors wearing these. Now, I can create more realistic looking scenes with \"people\" who look like real home service pros.\n\nREQUESTED IMPROVEMENTS: 4 or 5 seconds is not nearly long enough for a video clip! 10-12 seconds would serve my purposes far, far better.\n\nNext, if I ask for a word on screen- for example, \"Plumber\", I'd like to see that word where I need it and see it spelled correctly- not PLBBR or PMBLR.\n\nThanks.\n\nEDIT: Clarity",

      "body": "AI video generation might be a joke and currently a tool to jingle keys in front of investors.\n\nIt really isn’t going to get better in a professional sense. Looking at Sora 2, even the Pro API version runs about $0.50 per second of footage. So let’s do a deep dive into what that actually buys you: up to 15 seconds at 1792X1024, (Rec. 709).\n\nStrange resolution, right? For a \"Pro\" tier you’d expect at least full 1080. Why not? Because 1792X1024 is probably a technical sweet spot. As resolution increases, compute costs don’t rise linearly they go exponential.  It’s not just the number of pixels; it’s also the size of the model’s context windows. Doubling width and height (say 1024X576 to 2048X1152) quadruples the pixel count, but because the underlying latent tensors and self-attention mechanisms scale quadratically with spatial size, you hit a brick wall fast.  I assume they are avoiding 1080 as it starts to get into the danger zone of 80gig limits of these datacenter GPUS.  If they split the tensor across GPUS and screws with content length and precision and I gather shit gets weird.\n\nI expect firefly claiming 1080 it is probably up-rezed for the same reasons stating here. That or the lower frame rate of 24fps is making up for it or they are up-rezing from 1024 as it might be less noticeable.  \n\nPardon me here I've been hyperfocusing on this topic trying to unpack why some of the weird limitations and costs of AI video generation and starting to see the cracks past all the visual yikes, uncanny luminescence and weird sharpness.",
