    "selftext": "Hey guys, I need to get something off my chest. I don’t know what’s going on with Kling AI, but I’ve been consistently creating content since September and using Kling AI intensively as a paid premium user. I don’t know what’s up this week, but honestly, not a single video has worked. Out of my 8000 credits, I’ve burned through 4000 without getting a single usable result. This has never happened to me before, and I just don’t understand what’s going on this week.\n\nIt feels like things started to decline a bit just before their discount campaign, where out of 5 creations, 2-3 were useless. But now, literally 5 out of 5 are a complete waste. The objects don’t move at all, just stand still, and when they do move, they completely fall apart and turn into something really creepy.\n\nI can’t be the only one noticing this. It’s become completely unusable. Prompts are not being followed at all, and negative prompts are just ignored. Have any of you had similar experiences this week?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1gwvw5h)",

Or this feeling that not everyone is affected might come from the differences in our content. Animating humans seems to work best from what I’ve seen, maybe because it requires less processing power.
