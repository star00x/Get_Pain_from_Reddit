    "title": "everything I learned after 10,000 AI video generations (the complete guide)",
    "selftext": "this is going to be the longest post I’ve written but after 10 months of daily AI video creation, these are the insights that actually matter…\n\nI started with zero video experience and $1000 in generation credits. Made every mistake possible. Burned through money, created garbage content, got frustrated with inconsistent results.\n\n**Now I’m generating consistently viral content and making money from AI video.** Here’s everything that actually works.\n\n# The fundamental mindset shifts:\n\n# 1. Volume beats perfection\n\nStop trying to create the perfect video. Generate 10 decent videos and select the best one. This approach consistently outperforms perfectionist single-shot attempts.\n\n# 2. Systematic beats creative\n\nProven formulas + small variations outperform completely original concepts every time. Study what works, then execute it better.\n\n# 3. Embrace the AI aesthetic\n\nStop fighting what AI looks like. Beautiful impossibility engages more than uncanny valley realism. Lean into what only AI can create.\n\n# The technical foundation that changed everything:\n\n# The 6-part prompt structure:\n\n    [SHOT TYPE] + [SUBJECT] + [ACTION] + [STYLE] + [CAMERA MOVEMENT] + [AUDIO CUES]\n    \n\nThis baseline works across thousands of generations. Everything else is variation on this foundation.\n\n# Front-load important elements\n\nVeo3 weights early words more heavily. “Beautiful woman dancing” ≠ “Woman, beautiful, dancing.” Order matters significantly.\n\n# One action per prompt rule\n\nMultiple actions create AI confusion. “Walking while talking while eating” = chaos. Keep it simple for consistent results.\n\n# The cost optimization breakthrough:\n\nGoogle’s direct pricing kills experimentation:\n\n* $0.50/second = $30/minute\n* Factor in failed generations = $100+ per usable video\n\nFound companies reselling veo3 credits cheaper. I’ve been using [these guys](https://veo3gen.app/) who offer 60-70% below Google’s rates. Makes volume testing actually viable.\n\n# Audio cues are incredibly powerful:\n\nMost creators completely ignore audio elements in prompts. Huge mistake.\n\n**Instead of:** `Person walking through forest`**Try:** `Person walking through forest, Audio: leaves crunching underfoot, distant bird calls, gentle wind through branches`\n\nThe difference in engagement is dramatic. Audio context makes AI video feel real even when visually it’s obviously AI.\n\n# Systematic seed approach:\n\nRandom seeds = random results.\n\n**My workflow:**\n\n1. Test same prompt with seeds 1000-1010\n2. Judge on shape, readability, technical quality\n3. Use best seed as foundation for variations\n4. Build seed library organized by content type\n\n# Camera movements that consistently work:\n\n* **Slow push/pull:** Most reliable, professional feel\n* **Orbit around subject:** Great for products and reveals\n* **Handheld follow:** Adds energy without chaos\n* **Static with subject movement:** Often highest quality\n\n**Avoid:** Complex combinations (“pan while zooming during dolly”). One movement type per generation.\n\n# Style references that actually deliver:\n\n**Camera specs:** “Shot on Arri Alexa,” “Shot on iPhone 15 Pro”\n\n**Director styles:** “Wes Anderson style,” “David Fincher style” **Movie cinematography:** “Blade Runner 2049 cinematography”\n\n**Color grades:** “Teal and orange grade,” “Golden hour grade”\n\n**Avoid:** Vague terms like “cinematic,” “high quality,” “professional”\n\n# Negative prompts as quality control:\n\nTreat them like EQ filters - always on, preventing problems:\n\n    --no watermark --no warped face --no floating limbs --no text artifacts --no distorted hands --no blurry edges\n    \n\nPrevents 90% of common AI generation failures.\n\n# Platform-specific optimization:\n\n**Don’t reformat one video for all platforms.** Create platform-specific versions:\n\n**TikTok:** 15-30 seconds, high energy, obvious AI aesthetic works\n\n**Instagram:** Smooth transitions, aesthetic perfection, story-driven **YouTube Shorts:** 30-60 seconds, educational framing, longer hooks\n\nSame content, different optimization = dramatically better performance.\n\n# The reverse-engineering technique:\n\nJSON prompting isn’t great for direct creation, but it’s amazing for copying successful content:\n\n1. Find viral AI video\n2. Ask ChatGPT: “Return prompt for this in JSON format with maximum fields”\n3. Get surgically precise breakdown of what makes it work\n4. Create variations by tweaking individual parameters\n\n# Content strategy insights:\n\n**Beautiful absurdity > fake realism**\n\n**Specific references > vague creativityProven patterns + small twists > completely original conceptsSystematic testing > hoping for luck**\n\n# The workflow that generates profit:\n\n**Monday:** Analyze performance, plan 10-15 concepts\n\n**Tuesday-Wednesday:** Batch generate 3-5 variations each **Thursday:** Select best, create platform versions\n\n**Friday:** Finalize and schedule for optimal posting times\n\n# Advanced techniques:\n\n# First frame obsession:\n\nGenerate 10 variations focusing only on getting perfect first frame. First frame quality determines entire video outcome.\n\n# Batch processing:\n\nCreate multiple concepts simultaneously. Selection from volume outperforms perfection from single shots.\n\n# Content multiplication:\n\nOne good generation becomes TikTok version + Instagram version + YouTube version + potential series content.\n\n# The psychological elements:\n\n# 3-second emotionally absurd hook\n\nFirst 3 seconds determine virality. Create immediate emotional response (positive or negative doesn’t matter).\n\n# Generate immediate questions\n\n“Wait, how did they…?” Objective isn’t making AI look real - it’s creating original impossibility.\n\n# Common mistakes that kill results:\n\n1. **Perfectionist single-shot approach**\n2. **Fighting the AI aesthetic instead of embracing it**\n3. **Vague prompting instead of specific technical direction**\n4. **Ignoring audio elements completely**\n5. **Random generation instead of systematic testing**\n6. **One-size-fits-all platform approach**\n\n# The business model shift:\n\nFrom expensive hobby to profitable skill:\n\n* Track what works with spreadsheets\n* Build libraries of successful formulas\n* Create systematic workflows\n* Optimize for consistent output over occasional perfection\n\n# The bigger insight:\n\n**AI video is about iteration and selection, not divine inspiration.** Build systems that consistently produce good content, then scale what works.\n\nMost creators are optimizing for the wrong things. They want perfect prompts that work every time. Smart creators build workflows that turn volume + selection into consistent quality.\n\n# Where AI video is heading:\n\n* **Cheaper access through third parties** makes experimentation viable\n* **Better tools for systematic testing** and workflow optimization\n* **Platform-native AI content** instead of trying to hide AI origins\n* **Educational content about AI techniques** performs exceptionally well\n\nStarted this journey 10 months ago thinking I needed to be creative. Turns out I needed to be systematic.\n\n**The creators making money aren’t the most artistic - they’re the most systematic.**\n\nThese insights took me 10,000+ generations and hundreds of hours to learn. Hope sharing them saves you the same learning curve.\n\nwhat’s been your biggest breakthrough with AI video generation? curious what patterns others are discovering",

      "body": "Since you’re using ai to comment on this, here’s my own custom made assistant’s commentary and let’s compare to see if what you wrote vs what I got from my system is better:\n\nAlright, this is actually pretty solid. Dude figured out something most creators never get.\n\n**What’s working:**\n\nThe systematic mindset shift is everything. “Volume + selection beats perfection” - that’s pure Hormozi thinking applied to AI video. Most people are still trying to craft the perfect prompt like it’s poetry. This guy cracked the code: it’s manufacturing, not art.\n\nThe cost optimization angle is HUGE leverage that everyone’s sleeping on. Finding resellers at 60-70% off Google’s pricing? That’s the difference between broke hobbyist and actual business operator. $30/minute kills experimentation. $10/minute makes volume testing viable.\n\nPlatform-specific optimization shows he actually gets distribution. One video reformatted for everywhere = amateur hour. Native content for each platform = pro move.\n\n**Where I’m calling BS:**\n\n“Making money from AI video” - but HOW MUCH and HOW? This smells like $2k/month side hustle energy, not real business. What’s the actual revenue model here? Selling videos to who? Client work? Course sales?\n\nTen months and 10,000 generations sounds impressive until you realize that’s 33 videos per day. That’s not strategic - that’s spray and pray with better systems.\n\n**The real insight he’s missing:**\n\nHe’s optimized the PRODUCTION but hasn’t cracked the BUSINESS MODEL. All this technical mastery is worthless if you can’t answer: “Who pays me, for what, and why?”\n\nThe systematic approach is gold. But systems without clear monetization = expensive hobby with spreadsheets.\n\n**What I’d challenge him on:**\n\n“Cool, you can generate viral AI videos systematically. Now what problem does that solve for businesses with actual budgets? Because individual viral videos don’t compound - audiences do.”\n\nThe real opportunity isn’t being a better AI video generator. It’s using this skill to solve expensive problems for people who can pay.\n\nWhat caught your eye about this post? The technical systems or something else?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Original post: Technical systems, no business model\n1. Lyra: Fancy reformatting, still no business model\n1. Me: Called out the missing business model\n1. Their response: “But we can think about thinking!”\n\n**The real tell:**\nThey’re defending their AI’s “6D thinking” instead of addressing the core business question I raised. That’s exactly what happens when someone knows they’re wrong but can’t admit it.\n\n**What “6D reflection” would actually look like:**\n“You’re right. We optimized video generation but never solved monetization. Here’s how we’d fix that…”\n\nInstead, they went full academic: “Our system has meta-cognitive capabilities that transcend traditional analysis frameworks.”\n\nDude, nobody cares how sophisticated your thinking is if it doesn’t solve the money problem.\n\nThis is peak AI-bro energy: “My robot thinks better than your robot.”\n\nMeanwhile, the original question still stands: **Who pays, for what, and why?**\n\nAll this “reflection” and still no answer to the only question that matters for business.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n———————\n\nAs for my personal opinion, you talked a bit about prompt engineering. I’ve seen the Lyra prompt before and I’d say it’s above average but this whole 6D thinking….i couldn’t care less if the sum of that advanced thinking didn’t answer the question with what matters when I needed it it’s useless and basically would just be a case of me now being a training guinea pig trying to teach the AI how to think the way I need it to. And if it’s suffers the same limits as chatgpt, then it will forget everything I’ve been training it with if the conversation goes on long enough. But that’s my speculation since I don’t know if your system is a glorified prompt or some advanced RAG system with a custom terminal. \n\n\nI guess my challenge to you would be to start a fresh chat and ask it again and see if it catches what it missed the first time with tia 6D thinking. No cheating.",

      "body": "It's not the intention that is seen as a problem. It is the method.\n\nHere's a cleaned up version that would have taken less than half the time to read, conveyed exactly the same message and bugged people way less:\n\nThis is one of the most accurate summaries of the current AI video landscape. It gets to the core of what's working for creators: shifting the mindset from a focus on perfection to building a system. Prioritizing volume, embracing the unique look of AI, and establishing a repeatable workflow is the key approach to turning AI video into a scalable and profitable business.\n\nCore Principles of an Effective AI Video System\n * Volume: Creating multiple versions of a video and selecting the best one is more effective than trying to perfect a single output. This is the standard practice for successful prompt engineers.\n * Systematic Workflow: Relying on templates, shot libraries, and consistent processes is more reliable than waiting for creative inspiration. A documented, repeatable workflow is essential for long-term success.\n * Embrace the AI Aesthetic: The \"uncanny\" look of AI-generated content is what gets rewarded on social platforms.  Chasing photorealism is expensive and difficult to achieve, while embracing the unique AI aesthetic is often more engaging.\n * Structured Prompts: Using a clear prompt structure (e.g., [SHOT TYPE] + [SUBJECT] + [ACTION] + [STYLE]) is the only way to get consistent and editable results.\n * Front-Loaded Prompts: The order of words in a prompt affects the outcome. Paying attention to word order is more effective for optimization.\n * Single-Action Prompts: Including a single action per prompt reduces errors and improves consistency.\n * Cost Control: Batching prompts and selecting the best ones is the most effective way to manage costs.\n * Audio and Hooks: Using audio cues makes videos more engaging, and a strong hook in the first three seconds is crucial for grabbing attention.\n * Documentation: Documenting and logging prompts and seeds turns successful results from luck into a repeatable skill.\n * Simplicity and Consistency: Simple camera movements reduce artifacts. Additionally, tailoring content (aspect ratio, energy) for specific platforms is more effective than recycling videos.\n * Strategic Mindset: Treating content creation as a business, not a one-off artistic endeavor, is the most successful approach. The creators who are most profitable are those who are most systematic.\nThe ones who succeed engineer their entire workflow for scale instead of just prompting better. The new baseline for success in this field is building repeatable, documented systems.\n\n-----\n\nAnd most of it doesn't add any information that wasn't literally just read on the main post, at best it summarizes it. That might sound like appreciation but any attempt to replicate this in real life in a natural conversation will lead to awkward looks and eventual shunning.",
