    "title": "My complete AI video workflow that generates 20+ videos per week (systematic approach)",
    "selftext": "this is 5going to be the most detailed workflow breakdown but this system took me from 2 videos per week to 20+ consistently…\n\nUsed to approach AI video creation randomly. Generate something, post it, hope for the best. No system, no consistency, terrible results.\n\n**Built this systematic workflow over 6 months and now content creation is predictable and scalable.**\n\n# The weekly workflow structure:\n\n## **Monday: Analysis & Planning (2 hours)**\n\n- Analyze previous week’s performance across all platforms\n- Identify top-performing content themes and techniques\n- Research trending topics in AI and creative communities\n- Plan 15-20 concepts for upcoming week\n- Update successful prompt/seed libraries\n\n## **Tuesday-Wednesday: Batch Generation (6 hours total)**\n\n- Generate 3-5 variations for each planned concept\n- Focus on volume over perfection in generation phase\n- Test different seeds, camera angles, style references\n- Organize raw footage by concept and quality level\n- Initial culling - eliminate obviously failed generations\n\n## **Thursday: Selection & Optimization (4 hours)**\n\n- Select best 1-2 generations from each concept batch\n- Create platform-specific versions (TikTok/Instagram/YouTube)\n- Add final touches, timing adjustments, quality checks\n- Prepare thumbnails and covers for each platform\n- Write captions and hashtag strategies\n\n## **Friday: Content Finalization (2 hours)**\n\n- Final quality review and approval process\n- Schedule content for optimal posting times\n- Prepare cross-platform promotion strategy\n- Update tracking spreadsheets with concept details\n- Plan follow-up content for successful pieces\n\n# Daily generation workflow (Tuesday-Wednesday):\n\n## **Morning session (3 hours):**\n\n- **Hour 1**: Cyberpunk/tech content generation\n- **Hour 2**: Lifestyle/aspirational content generation\n- **Hour 3**: Action/dynamic content generation\n\n## **Afternoon session (3 hours):**\n\n- **Hour 1**: Product/commercial content generation\n- **Hour 2**: Artistic/creative content generation\n- **Hour 3**: Educational/tutorial content generation\n\n**Batching by content type maintains creative consistency and technical efficiency.**\n\n# Content multiplication strategy:\n\n## **One concept becomes multiple variations:**\n\n**Example - “Person working late at night” concept:**\n\n1. **Cyberpunk version**: Neon lighting, futuristic setup, electronic audio\n2. **Cozy version**: Warm lighting, coffee cup, ambient sounds\n3. **Professional version**: Clean office, natural lighting, business audio\n4. **Artistic version**: Dramatic lighting, creative angles, atmospheric audio\n\n**4 different videos from 1 core concept.**\n\n## **Platform-specific adaptation:**\n\nEach variation gets optimized for:\n- **TikTok**: 15-20 seconds, high energy, trending audio compatibility\n\n- **Instagram**: 25-30 seconds, aesthetic perfection, smooth flow\n- **YouTube**: 45-60 seconds, educational value, professional quality\n\n**12 total videos from 1 original concept.**\n\n# Technical workflow optimization:\n\n## **Prompt template system:**\n\nPre-built templates for different content categories:\n\n```\nPortrait template: Close-up + [subject] + [emotion] + [style] + [camera] + [audio]\nAction template: Wide shot + [character] + [movement] + [energy] + [tracking] + [dynamic audio]\nProduct template: Macro + [item] + [reveal] + [commercial] + [orbital] + [relevant audio]\n```\n\n## **Seed library organization:**\n\nCategorized successful seeds:\n\n```\nTech content seeds: 1002, 1007, 2156, 3089\nLifestyle seeds: 1334, 1445, 2223, 3156\nAction seeds: 2047, 2334, 2889, 3223\n```\n\n**Eliminates random guessing, ensures quality consistency.**\n\n## **Style reference database:**\n\nOrganized successful combinations:\n\n```\nCyberpunk: \"Blade Runner cinematography\" + purple/blue grade\nLifestyle: \"Shot on iPhone 15 Pro\" + golden hour lighting\nProfessional: \"Shot on Arri Alexa\" + teal and orange grade\n```\n\n# Cost optimization workflow:\n\n## **Generation budget allocation:**\n\n- 40% - New concept testing\n- 35% - Successful concept variations\n- 25% - Platform optimization versions\n\n## **Quality vs quantity balance:**\n\n- Generate 5-8 variations per concept\n- Select best 1-2 for development\n- Create 3 platform versions of winners\n\n**Cost per finished video: $15-25 through systematic approach**\n\nBeen using veo3gen[.]app for workflow optimization since Google’s direct pricing makes systematic batch generation cost-prohibitive. 70% cost reduction enables volume-based quality approach.\n\n# Performance tracking system:\n\n## **Content performance spreadsheet:**\n\nTrack every generated video:\n- Concept category and technical details\n- Seeds and prompt formulas used\n\n- Platform performance metrics\n- Engagement rates and viral potential\n- Cost per video and ROI calculation\n\n## **Pattern recognition analysis:**\n\nWeekly review identifies:\n- Which content types perform best on which platforms\n- Successful prompt formulas and technical combinations\n- Seasonal trends and audience preference shifts\n\n- Cost-effective generation strategies\n\n# Quality control checkpoints:\n\n## **Generation phase quality gates:**\n\n1. **Technical execution** - Clean, artifact-free footage\n2. **Concept clarity** - Clear visual storytelling\n3. **Platform suitability** - Appropriate for target platform\n4. **Engagement potential** - Has viral or shareable elements\n\n## **Final approval criteria:**\n\n1. **Professional quality** - Meets technical standards\n2. **Brand consistency** - Matches overall content strategy\n3. **Platform optimization** - Formatted correctly for each platform\n4. **Content value** - Provides entertainment or education value\n\n# Scalability considerations:\n\n## **Team workflow integration:**\n\nSystem designed to work with:\n- Content strategist (planning and analysis)\n- Generation specialist (prompt execution)\n\n- Editor (platform optimization)\n- Social media manager (posting and engagement)\n\n## **Automation opportunities:**\n\n- Prompt template systems\n- Batch generation scheduling\n- Performance tracking integration\n- Social media scheduling tools\n\n# Advanced workflow techniques:\n\n## **Trending topic integration:**\n\n- Daily scan of AI/creative community trends\n- Rapid concept adaptation for trending topics\n- Quick generation and posting for trend-jacking\n- Performance tracking of trend-based content\n\n## **Seasonal content planning:**\n\n- Month-ahead concept planning\n- Holiday and event-based content preparation\n- Seasonal style and theme adjustments\n- Long-term audience engagement strategies\n\n## **Content series development:**\n\n- Multi-part concept development\n- Character or theme consistency across videos\n- Audience retention through series progression\n- Cross-platform series optimization\n\n# Time allocation breakdown:\n\n**Weekly time investment: 14 hours total**\n- Planning: 2 hours (14%)\n- Generation: 6 hours (43%)\n\n- Optimization: 4 hours (29%)\n- Finalization: 2 hours (14%)\n\n**Output: 20+ finished, platform-optimized videos**\n\n**Time per finished video: ~40 minutes average**\n\n# ROI and business metrics:\n\n## **Content performance improvement:**\n\n- **Average views per video**: +300% vs random approach\n- **Engagement rates**: +250% vs unoptimized content\n- **Viral content rate**: +400% vs inconsistent posting\n- **Time efficiency**: +500% vs random generation\n\n## **Business impact:**\n\n- **Content creation costs**: 60% reduction per video\n- **Posting consistency**: 100% reliable weekly schedule\n- **Brand recognition**: Significant improvement through consistency\n- **Revenue generation**: Consistent, predictable income stream\n\n# Common workflow mistakes to avoid:\n\n1. **Perfectionist single-video focus** instead of volume selection\n2. **Random generation** instead of systematic batching\n3. **Platform-agnostic approach** instead of platform-specific optimization\n4. **No performance tracking** instead of data-driven improvement\n5. **Inconsistent scheduling** instead of reliable posting rhythm\n\n# Integration with other strategies:\n\n## **Workflow + reverse engineering:**\n\nSystematic analysis and recreation of viral content within workflow structure.\n\n## **Workflow + seed bracketing:**\n\nQuality optimization techniques integrated into batch generation sessions.\n\n## **Workflow + platform optimization:**\n\nPlatform-specific creation built into core workflow rather than afterthought.\n\nthis systematic workflow completely transformed my AI video creation from chaotic experimentation to predictable content production. consistency and scalability are game-changers for long-term success.\n\nwhat workflow systems have you built for AI content creation? curious how others are organizing systematic approaches\n\nhope this helps someone build more efficient and scalable content creation systems <3",
