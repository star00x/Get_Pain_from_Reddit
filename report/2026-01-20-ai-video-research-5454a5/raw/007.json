    "selftext": "In the past few days I've been experimenting with SORA to generate my first attempts at AI generated reels. I choose a simple subject: essentially a short \"cinematic\" video of an historically accurate Dante Alighieri writing the Divine Comedy.\n\nHowever, no matter how clear, detailed, or restrictive I make the prompt, **SORA consistently ignores basic visual instructions**, especially regarding:\n\n* Facial hair: I explicitly establish \"*no beard\" ,\"it is forbidden to depict any beard\", \"remove any and all facial hair\"* and so on. I tried this with both a normal prompt and through the \"remix\" function on other previously obtained clips. It adds the beard EVERY-SINGLE-FUCKING-TIME.\n* Baldness: : I explicitly establish that I do not wish to show a \"*bald head*\" and yet it appears frequently.\n* Headpiece: I give a precise description of Dante’s iconic red cap with a white veil under it and it is still ignored every single time or replaced with modern elements.\n\nI've tried everything, including:\n\n* Writing prompts in both English and Italian.\n* Under the guidance of ChatGPT I tried using character tag syntax like \"*Visualize the character as: DANTE\\_ALIGHIERI\\_HISTORICAL\\_VERSION*\", also establishing \"fixed attributes\".\n* I tried removing the name “Dante” entirely to avoid internal model bias and just described what character I wished to generate.\n* I tried reinforcing the above mentioned constraints multiple times within the prompt.\n* As mentioned I tried adding negatives like \"do not depict...\", \"it is forbidden to...\" and so on, repeating them clearly.\n\nYet SORA keeps generating versions with a bald, bearded man sometimes in vague medieval garb, which completely defeats the goal of historical accuracy. Even if I avoid naming Dante altogether, the model defaults to some generalized medieval cliché, most often than not with a fucking beard and other traits I DID NOT REQUIRED. \n\nI even tried attaching an image, clarifying that it was only meant for reference, and SORA inserts it into the videoclip rather than using it as such.\n\nHas anyone figured out how to enforce strict visual fidelity with SORA? Historical or otherwise**.**  \nIs there a way to force the model to follow simple character design constraints?\n\nOr is SORA just not there yet when it comes to processesing the required visual accuracy? \n\nI am honestly getting frustrated and I’d appreciate any kind of help here. Thanks in advance to all.",

      "body": "You're running into one of the most persistent and frustrating limitations of current generative video models like Sora: prompt adherence and character consistency, especially in highly specific visual constraints like facial features, attire, and historical accuracy, is still far from reliable — no matter how precisely you word your prompts.\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of what’s going on and what you can do:\n\n\n---\n\n\n🔍 Why Sora Isn’t Listening\n\n\n1. Learned Biases Override Prompts\n\n\nSora is trained on a massive dataset with latent biases about “medieval” characters. If you mention anything resembling “Dante” or a “poet from 1300s Florence,” it will likely default to a stereotyped, often generic, medieval man — usually bearded, sometimes bald, and wearing vague robes. This is because the visual associations encoded during training are stronger than your negative prompts.\n\n\nEven removing “Dante” from the prompt doesn’t always help, because the visual tropes are tied to the era and occupation you’re describing (e.g., “Italian medieval poet”).\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n2. Negations Don’t Work Reliably\n\n\nTelling Sora to “not do” something (e.g., “no beard,” “not bald,” “forbidden”) often fails, especially in visuals. Unlike text models, visual generation models are not good at understanding negation. They can interpret positive attributes better than prohibitions.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n3. Remix and Reference Images Are Loosely Interpreted\n\n\nIf you’re using an image as a “reference only,” but don’t explicitly tell the system to not show it directly, it may try to literally insert it. And even if you do, the model may still hallucinate a different style or insert it anyway due to internal limitations in how it handles references.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n✅ What You Can Actually Do About It\n\n\nHere’s a blunt list of practical suggestions — a few of these do help, but none are 100% guaranteed due to model limitations.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n🧱 1. Use a Control Image — with Clear Face and Costume\n\n\nInstead of only using text, use an image that exactly shows what you want, and instruct:\n\n\n> “Use this reference image to lock in face structure, headwear, and costume design. Do not change facial hair, do not add baldness.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrop the image tightly on the face if that’s the part you want control over.\n\n\nTry editing the reference image beforehand to erase all undesired features.\n\n\nUpload multiple reference images (side profile, front, action shot) if the remix allows it.\n\n\n\n\n🟡 Note: Sometimes this gets ignored, but repeated attempts with clear facial framing can help Sora lock on.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n🧠 2. Rephrase Attributes Positively\n\n\nInstead of saying:\n\n\n> “Do not add a beard or show a bald head.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSay:\n\n\n> “A clean-shaven man with a full head of hair. Sharp jawline visible. Short, dark hair only. No facial hair of any kind.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositively reinforcing what you do want helps more than stacking negatives.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n🎯 3. Specify in “Shot Language”\n\n\nSora understands “camera language” better than you might expect.\n\n\nTry:\n\n\n> “Close-up of a clean-shaven man, wearing a red cap with white veil underneath. His jawline is fully visible. Medium shot shows the full outfit in red Florentine robe. No beard visible in any frame.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can guide the model’s focus and suppress undesired hallucinations.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n👤 4. Name a Different Identity or Create a “Custom” Character\n\n\nAvoid using “Dante” altogether. Instead, frame it like:\n\n\n> “A clean-shaven Italian poet from 1300 Florence, based on [insert description of Dante without name]. Name this character: Alighiero. He wears a red cap with a white veil underneath.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives the model less historical baggage to misinterpret.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n🛠 5. Post-Edit with AI Video Tools\n\n\nIf nothing else works — consider a two-step process:\n\n\n1. Use Sora to generate the core video.\n\n\n\n\n2. Use tools like Runway Gen-2, Pika, or AI video inpainting (like Adobe Firefly or Photoshop for frames) to:\n\n\nRemove facial hair frame-by-frame.\n\n\nReplace headwear to match your intended design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, it’s annoying and manual — but it’s currently the only way to guarantee historical fidelity until these models improve.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n🧪 6. Try Different Prompt Sets\n\n\nSora’s model may behave differently depending on how you phrase inputs — even minor changes in syntax or description structure can lead to better alignment.\n\n\nCreate a “prompt tree” where you vary:\n\n\nThe order of details.\n\n\nThe language style (narrative vs. declarative).\n\n\nWhether you define appearance or actions first.\n\n\n\n\nYou might hit a combo that sticks better.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n❗ Brutal Truth\n\n\nRight now, you cannot force Sora to follow strict visual constraints consistently. It’s simply not there yet.\n\n\nThese models weren’t trained to obey prompts rigidly, and their default behavior is to fall back on visually stereotyped templates. Until OpenAI releases:\n\n\nA character anchoring tool (like ControlNet for video),\n\n\nOr multi-frame fine-tuning on your own character designs,\n\n\n\n\n…this kind of work will remain hit-or-miss.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nSource: ChatGPT",

      "body": "I was running into this in my art project, the most solid way I found was to prompt using JSON, I iterated with Gemini for like two hours, showing him my natural language prompts and the outputs and what I need changing and specified the prompts need to be in JSON. That gave me the best consistency in visual style, and character look across a group of images. I now have a structured JSON template for my specific project. Which I also attached to on other gem. I describe what I need and it creates the JSON prompt needed for my desired output.\n\nAbout historical figure likeness. My best advice is to never use their names directly. Ask chatgpt in text to give you a comprehensive visual discription of your target character according to historical sources. Then ask them to: write visual discription of \"new name\" who exactly matches the likeness of \"historic figure\" in all aspects, optimize the language for Sora prompt.\n\nFrom then on, use this new discription for your character in scene prompt.",

Translating Natural Language prompts to a well structured JSON, parsing the nuance of my intent, the complex look/color grade/ camera and lens... etc, was a very complicated task that Gemini's big context window and logic was best at. I hit a wall using Chatgpt in this specific case (generating JSON prompts), because i used up all the memory, and it started forgetting. Chatgpt is wonderful though at generating amazingly detailed Natural Language prompts. and it will give you great strategies to barely pass the decency filter if you are getting stopped by it. Gemini tends to be a square, it's decency filter is way too conservative, it will change interactions and attire to be more rigid, plain and dull. so when you want Natural Language prompts use Chatgpt, When you want Code or to reverse engineer a particular visual style, you have to use JSON and Gemini.\n\nThe issue i was trying to solve is that my comprehensive detailed prompts generated by Chatgpt were still outputting inconsistent \"look and feel\", Sora was creating 4 outputs with non-matching white balance, some where painterly, etc. I wanted a method to SET IN STONE the visual look and style across a series of images. the preset didn't work, so i took the time to iterate with Gemini until it created a solid well structured JSON which i paste directly in the image prompt window as is in sora. This almost guarantees the look I'm going for.\n\nbut the JSON is complex to edit for new scenes. to smooth-out that work flow (generating a new JSON from a new scene description), i created a \"Gem\" with explicit instructions of what to output after parsing the intent of a new scene described in natural language.\n\nEdit: I have to add, the JSON structure Defines characters in a code block, Sora sticks to these descriptors in JSON format like it's bible. That is why i suggested this method, although its too technical and complex. Better to waste text tokens solidifying the JSON structure than to waste limited image/video generations IMO.",
