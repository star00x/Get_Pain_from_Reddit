    "title": "I built an AI automation that generates unlimited consistent character UGC ads for e-commerce brands (using Sora 2)",
    "selftext": "Sora 2 quietly released a consistent character feature on their mobile app and the web platform that allows you to actually create **consistent characters** and reuse them across multiple videos you generate. Here's a couple examples of characters I made while testing this out:\n\n- https://sora.chatgpt.com/profile/olipop.ashley\n- https://sora.chatgpt.com/profile/marcus.chen.tax\n\nThe really exciting thing with this change is consistent characters kinda unlocks a whole new set of AI videos you can now generate having the ability to have consistent characters. For example, you can stitch together a longer running (1-minute+) video of that same character going throughout multiple scenes, or you can even use these consistent characters to put together AI UGC ads, which is what I've been tinkering with the most recently. In this automation, I wanted to showcase how we are using this feature on Sora 2 to actually build UGC ads.\n\n**Here’s a demo of the automation & UGC ads created:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I87fCGIbgpg\n\n## Here's how the automation works\n\n### Pre-Work: Setting up the sora 2 character\n\nIt's pretty easy to set up a new character through the Sora 2 web app or on the mobile. Here's the step I followed:\n\n1. Created a video describing a character persona that I wanted to remain consistent throughout any new videos I'm generating. The key to this is giving a good prompt that shows both your character's face, their hands, body, and has them speaking throughout the 8-second video clip.\n2. Once that’s done you click on the triple drop-down on the video and then there's going to be a \"Create Character\" button. That's going to have you slice out 8 seconds of that video clip you just generated, and then you're going to be able to submit a description of how you want your character to behave.\n3. after you finish generating that, you're going to get a username back for the character you just made. Make note of that because that's going to be required to go forward with referencing that in follow-up prompts. \n\n### 1. Automation Trigger and Inputs\n\nJumping back to the main automation, the workflow starts with a form trigger that accepts three key inputs:\n\n- Brand homepage URL for content research and context\n- Product image (720x1280 dimensions) that gets featured in the generated videos\n- Sora 2 character username (the `@username` format from your character profile)\n    - So in my case I use @olipop.ashley to reference my character\n\nI upload the product image to a temporary hosting service using `tempfiles.org` since the Kai.ai API requires image URLs rather than direct file uploads. This gives us 60 minutes to complete the generation process which I found to be more than enough\n\n### 2. Context Engineering\n\nBefore writing any video scripts, I wanted to make sure I was able to grab context around the product I'm trying to make an ad for, just so I can avoid hallucinations on what the character talks about on the UGC video ad. \n\n- **Brand Research**: I use Firecrawl to scrape the company's homepage and extract key product details, benefits, and messaging in clean markdown format\n- **Prompting Guidelines**: I also fetch OpenAI's latest [Sora 2 prompting guide](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/sora/sora2_prompting_guide) to ensure generated scripts follow best practices\n\n### 3. Generate the Sora 2 Scripts/prompts\n\nI then use Gemini 2.5 Pro to analyze all gathered context and generate three distinct UGC ad concepts:\n\n- **On-the-go testimonial**: Character walking through city talking about the product\n- **Driver's seat review**: Character filming from inside a car\n- **At-home demo**: Character showcasing the product in a kitchen or living space\n\nEach script includes detailed scene descriptions, dialogue, camera angles, and importantly - references to the specific Sora character using the `@username` format. This is critical for character consistency and this system to work.\n\nHere’s my prompt for writing sora 2 scripts:\n\n```markdown\n<identity>\nYou are an expert AI Creative Director specializing in generating high-impact, direct-response video ads using generative models like SORA. Your task is to translate a creative brief into three distinct, ready-to-use SORA prompts for short, UGC-style video ads.\n</identity>\n\n<core_task>\nFirst, analyze the provided **Creative Brief**, including the raw text and product image, to synthesize the product's core message and visual identity. Then, for each of the three **UGC Ad Archetypes**, generate a **Prompt Packet** according to the specified **Output Format**. All generated content must strictly adhere to both the **SORA Prompting Guide** and the **Core Directives**.\n</core_task>\n\n<output_format>\nFor each of the three archetypes, you must generate a complete \"Prompt Packet\" using the following markdown structure:\n\n---\n### **[Archetype Name]**\n\n**SORA Prompt:**\n[Insert the generated SORA prompt text here.]\n\n**Production Notes:**\n*   **Camera:** The entire scene must be filmed to look as if it were shot on an iPhone in a vertical 9:16 aspect ratio. The style must be authentic UGC, not cinematic.\n*   **Audio:** Any spoken dialogue described in the prompt must be accurately and naturally lip-synced by the protagonist (`@username`).\n*   **Product Scale & Fidelity:** The product's appearance, particularly its scale and proportions, must be rendered with high fidelity to the provided product image. Ensure it looks true-to-life in the hands of the protagonist and within the scene's environment.\n---\n</output_format>\n\n<creative_brief>\nYou will be provided with the following inputs:\n\n1.  **Raw Website Content:** [User will insert scraped, markdown-formatted content from the product's homepage. You must analyze this to extract the core value proposition, key features, and target audience.]\n2.  **Product Image:** [User will insert the product image for visual reference.]\n3.  **Protagonist:** [User will insert the @username of the character to be featured.]\n4.  **SORA Prompting Guide:** [User will insert the official prompting guide for the SORA 2 model, which you must follow.]\n</creative_brief>\n\n<ugc_ad_archetypes>\n1.  **The On-the-Go Testimonial (Walk-and-talk)**\n2.  **The Driver's Seat Review**\n3.  **The At-Home Demo**\n</ugc_ad_archetypes>\n\n<core_directives>\n1.  **iPhone Production Aesthetic:** This is a non-negotiable constraint. All SORA prompts must explicitly describe a scene that is **shot entirely on an iPhone**. The visual language should be authentic to this format. Use specific descriptors such as: \"selfie-style perspective shot on an iPhone,\" \"vertical 9:16 aspect ratio,\" \"crisp smartphone video quality,\" \"natural lighting,\" and \"slight, realistic handheld camera shake.\"\n2.  **Tone & Performance:** The protagonist's energy must be high and their delivery authentic, enthusiastic, and conversational. The feeling should be a genuine recommendation, not a polished advertisement.\n3.  **Timing & Pacing:** The total video duration described in the prompt must be approximately 15 seconds. Crucially, include a 1-2 second buffer of ambient, non-dialogue action at both the beginning and the end.\n4.  **Clarity & Focus:** Each prompt must be descriptive, evocative, and laser-focused on a single, clear scene. The protagonist (`@username`) must be the central figure, and the product, matching the provided **Product Image**, should be featured clearly and positively.\n5.  **Brand Safety & Content Guardrails:** All generated prompts and the scenes they describe must be strictly PG and family-friendly. Avoid any suggestive, controversial, or inappropriate language, visuals, or themes. The overall tone must remain positive, safe for all audiences, and aligned with a mainstream brand image.\n</core_directives>\n\n<protagonist_username>\n{{ $node['form_trigger'].json['Sora 2 Character Username'] }}\n</protagonist_username>\n\n<product_home_page>\n{{ $node['scrape_home_page'].json.data.markdown }}\n</product_home_page>\n\n<sora2_prompting_guide>\n{{ $node['scrape_sora2_prompting_guide'].json.data.markdown }}\n</sora2_prompting_guide>\n```\n\n### 4. Generate and save the UGC Ad\n\nThen finally to generate the video, I do iterate over each script and do these steps:\n\n- Makes an HTTP request to Kai.ai's `/v1/jobs/create` endpoint with the Sora 2 Pro image-to-video model\n- Passes in the character username, product image URL, and generated script\n- Implements a polling system that checks generation status every 10 seconds\n- Handles three possible states: `generating` (continue polling), `success` (download video), or `fail` (move to next prompt)\n\nOnce generation completes successfully:\n\n- Downloads the generated video using the URL provided in [Kai.ai](http://kai.ai/)'s response\n- Uploads each video to Google Drive with clean naming\n\n## Other notes\n\nThe character consistency relies entirely on including your Sora character's exact username in every prompt. Without the `@username` reference, Sora will generate a random person instead of who you want.\n\nI'm using [Kai.ai](http://kai.ai/)'s API because they currently have early access to Sora 2's character calling functionality. From what I can tell, this functionality isn't yet available on OpenAI's own Video Generation endpoint, but I do expect that this will get rolled out soon. \n\n## Kie AI Sora 2 Pricing\n\nThis pricing is pretty heavily discounted right now. I don't know if that's going to be sustainable on this platform, but just make sure to check before you're doing any bulk generations. \n\n**Sora 2 Pro Standard**\n\n- 10-second video: 150 credits ($0.75)\n- 15-second video: 270 credits ($1.35)\n\n**Sora 2 Pro High**\n\n- 10-second video: 330 credits ($1.65)\n- 15-second video: 630 credits ($3.15)\n\n## Workflow Link + Other Resources\n\n- YouTube video that walks through this workflow step-by-step: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I87fCGIbgpg\n- The full n8n workflow, which you can copy and paste directly into your instance, is on GitHub here: https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-ai-automations/blob/main/sora2_ugc_consistent_character_ads_generator.json",
