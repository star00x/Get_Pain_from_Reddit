    "selftext": "Hey all — Has anyone figured out a reliable workflow to keep characters continuity intact across multiple scenes?\n\nI’m working on a storyboard/music video project using GROK Chat + Imagine for both images and video gen, and I keep running into the same challenge: I just can't seam to be able to keep my characters looking the same between segments.\n\nI noticed I can upload an image in GROK Chat, but just can't seam to understand prompts like:\n\n\"*Deeply analyze the attached reference image to gather the characters physical appearance in details for the man and the woman, and save it in your context. Now imagine a new scene, one year later. \\[detailed description of the scene here...\\]*\".\n\nWhen I try the above, GROK copies too much elements of the previous scene, and disregards elements of the new scene I want. When I flag that, it does generates to scene I want, but characters don't look like the reference image at all.\n\nWould love to hear what’s worked for you:\n\n* Prompting techniques?\n* Prompt formatting?\n* Creative workarounds?\n* Style/descriptor tricks?\n\nThanks in advance — any help is super appreciated!",

AI hasn't quite nailed the subtle nuances that make people unique individuals. So you can start with, say, Donald Trump and after 20 iterations end with Alec Baldwin playing Donald Trump on SNL (so very similar looking people with the same outfits, hair styles, body types, etc but a distinctively different person).",
