> I actually notice the opposite. Everything gets shiny. What I do is about every other frame I put it in GIMP and up the brightness a bit. (GIMP is basically open source photoshop)

> As things progressed, I noticed the generations become more cartoonish.  Once I had 60 seconds, I ran the whole video though an app called FakeMe, where you can replace the face.
> 
> So, I take my Grok generated videos, stitch them together, run it through FakeMe with a better quality facial image, hit send.  About 2 mi items later I get a better video with the correct face.

> While it’s unavoidable to have “last frame” issues if you keep continuing, that’s mostly avoidable if you plan your shots.
> 
> Whenever you can:
> 
> Start with a neutral image that’s a good “character sheet” with multiple perspectives.
> 
> Tell image edit to place said character into the a specific scene for the beginning of a shot.
> 
> Generate video with your “storyboard.”

> Same issues. Also having trouble with gradual color desaturation if you’re using the final frame as a starting point for the next. It’s like half grayscale by the 4th segment.
