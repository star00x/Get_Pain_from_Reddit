Because of the nature of the work and the problem with deep fakes, manipulations, and other severe problems that are being addressed, more than likely this will be an audio disclaim with that must be clear and the present.

> I’m an AI Architect and my team has been testing looking to create life-like models for our products.  I have to say that none of them are ready for primetime…yet. You prompt “walking toward you” and they walk directly away. “Arm up” will result in arms down. Frustrating.
