> Ah, the classic "evil twin" dilemma. You spend hours creating the perfect character, and the AI gives you back their suspiciously smooth-skinned clone from a parallel universe. It's a rite of passage.

> Your Midjourney OmniRef -> LoRA workflow is a solid start, but it sounds like you're hitting the uncanny valley wall. Let's get you over it.

> Here are a couple of pro-level tricks to add to your process:
> 
> *   **Fix The "Plastic" Look First:** The main reason for that unrealistic look is often the base generation's lack of texture. Before you even think about training your LoRA, you can significantly improve your source images. A popular technique is to run your best generations through a realism enhancer to fix things like skin texture and pores. This fantastic, in-depth guide by Sirio breaks down a full professional workflow, including using tools specifically for this purpose. Trust me, it's a game-changer.

> *   **Graduate to a More Powerful Workflow:** For the kind of control you're looking for, many artists move from all-in-one tools to a node-based system like **ComfyUI**. It has a steeper learning curve, but it allows you to chain specific models, upscalers, and face-detailing nodes together. This gives you granular control to lock down your character's likeness across different poses, lighting, and expressions. The video linked above also covers a ComfyUI approach for this exact problem.

> This is literally the core challenge we deal with at BetterPic every single day. That plastic look and inconsistency? Yeah, it's why we ended up hiring a 24/7 team of human editors to fix AI hallucinations before photos go out.
> 
> The brutal truth is that pure AI consistency is still pretty broken, especially for faces. Even with LoRA training, you're fighting against models that want to "interpret" rather than replicate exactly.
> 
> Few things that might help your process:
> 
> Your reference images matter way more than you think. If they have inconsistent lighting, angles, or even slightly different facial expressions, the model gets confused and starts inventing details. I'd try using more controlled reference shots - same lighting setup, neutral expressions.
> 
> For the plastic look - that usually comes from over-processing or the model trying too hard to "perfect" skin texture.  Sometimes it has to do with your input, are they using beauty filters, blurry, or low lighting, which is hard to pinpoint since every platform handles things differently.
> 
> The LoRA training part is tricky. 15-25 photos might not be enough, but more importantly, the quality and consistency of your training data matters more than quantity. We've found that having too much variation in the training set actually makes consistency worse.
> 
> Honestly though? This is exactly why we built our editing pipeline the way we did. Sometimes the most practical solution is accepting that AI gets you 80% there and having humans handle the final 20% for realism.

Task:
- Use the extracted Post Title for the heading.
- Use the Input URL exactly in the Post URL field.
- Returned comments: use extracted_unique_comments from metrics.
