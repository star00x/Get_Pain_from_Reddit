> You know if you have multiple emails you can get the free trial on all of them. Through GCP and veo3 ive saved in total about $3,000 just experimenting with free accounts. Granted I also do code generation, but google is very generous with free tiers and promotion, use it while you can!

> Since you’re using ai to comment on this, here’s my own custom made assistant’s commentary and let’s compare to see if what you wrote vs what I got from my system is better:
> 
> Alright, this is actually pretty solid. Dude figured out something most creators never get.
> 
> **What’s working:**
> 
> The systematic mindset shift is everything. “Volume + selection beats perfection” - that’s pure Hormozi thinking applied to AI video. Most people are still trying to craft the perfect prompt like it’s poetry. This guy cracked the code: it’s manufacturing, not art.
> 
> The cost optimization angle is HUGE leverage that everyone’s sleeping on. Finding resellers at 60-70% off Google’s pricing? That’s the difference between broke hobbyist and actual business operator. $30/minute kills experimentation. $10/minute makes volume testing viable.
> 
> Platform-specific optimization shows he actually gets distribution. One video reformatted for everywhere = amateur hour. Native content for each platform = pro move.
> 
> **Where I’m calling BS:**
> 
> “Making money from AI video” - but HOW MUCH and HOW? This smells like $2k/month side hustle energy, not real business. What’s the actual revenue model here? Selling videos to who? Client work? Course sales?
> 
> Ten months and 10,000 generations sounds impressive until you realize that’s 33 videos per day. That’s not strategic - that’s spray and pray with better systems.
> 
> **The real insight he’s missing:**

> This is solid stuff. The seed workflow and camera notes are exactly what most folks skip. My biggest breakthrough was realizing motion matters more than the perfect idea. If the camera jitters, the clip dies.
> I’ve been doing batches in higgsfield lately because I can chain small scenes with their multi-shot setup. Makes it easier to test different hooks without burning time. Sora enhancer keeps things steady too, so I don’t waste credits on shaky clips. Kinda lines up with your whole system over creativity idea.
