> This dogshit is not worth $200 per month when Huyuan is open source and Kling, Minimax & Pika are free. The OG Model ? Debatable, since we never even got to test its output quality ourselves, for all we know what we saw were most likely cherrypicked for marketing purposes.

> Pika isn't really free. The older version is free (1.5) but the latest 2.0 version that is comparable to sora is behind a subscription. Ontop of that you need to pay $28 a month to get commercial use. I wouldn't put it in the same category as Kling and Minimax.

> They don't care about Dall-E. They haven't marketed it, they haven't talked about it, no hype whatsoever. They were actively hyping up Sora, and released it during their mega hyped "12 days of shipmas", so clearly they care about Sora and its reception. Meaning, Dall-E and Sora isn't comparable.

> Now the best performing one is Google Veo 2, but that one is only available for closed beta testers. This means that there's a lot of room for improvement (Veo 2 is proof), but it'll take a while and those improvements will be gradual, and other companies will probably continue outperforming Sora before they can release it.

> I blatantly disagree. I've been generating hundreds of videos across all models since we were just working with open-source stuff like potato1 and zeroscope, then onto Runway, I was a beta tester for Kling before it launched in the west, then Lumalabs, then Pika, then even LeonardoAI which I found particularly cool for some stuff. Runway Gen-3 was the king for a long time, but Sora blows it out of the water for literally everything I can throw at it. "Sora sucks!" - no it doesn't, you just don't know how to prompt properly or how to use it properly. I have hundreds of Sora generations at this point which I could show to people and for your average everyday human - 8/10 would not be able to tell it's AI. For consistent 20-second generations, the amount of sheer dynamism that every generation manages to pump out is unparalled. High end fashion videos? Professional marketing videos? Vintage period era clips? Landscape shots? It literally makes me anything I ask of it - 2x720p 20 second variations - 5 of these at once so 10 20 second generations - and I can literally take between 10-15 seconds out of each of those gens and use them for content that looks professional, real, and convincing. I am so so sick of people crying out that it's a shit model when the real barrier is that they just don't test it and actually learn how to use it. All of these tools WORK DIFFERENTLY, and some require a bit more fine-tuning and fiddling with your prompts than others. But once you work out your structure and flow - Sora is unbeatable imo. For txt2video that is. I still think Kling and Hailuo…

> You want the truth? It's because openai carries the flag of American AI supremacy and people are reluctant to believe china could have an edge even if it does. When sora clips were launched, it was well known that it was cherry picked as hell, and so many skeptics were silenced. News outlets were paid millions to plaster the name "Sora" everywhere, even though the product didn't launch for another year. Openai published no papers on the technique not training data because both were stolen, mostly from Google. 
> 
> Yes sora is an inferior product, and that's because it's versatility is limited by the lobotomy and model distillation needed to achieve a good solution. If you think back, dalle was never the sota in image generation for long, but it definately garnered the most media attention. This is openai's endgame. They are not interested in providing the right tools to people, or empower them. They steal from their investors and users alike, all in the name of being the best.
